## Forecasting

### [COVID-19 Forecasting Evaluation](https://delphi.cmu.edu/forecast-eval/)

We host a forecast evaluation dashboard to compare the historical performance of the forecasts submitted to the [COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https://covid19forecasthub.org/).

### [Flu Forecasting (FluSight)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/flusight/index.html)

We participate in the weekly Flu forecasting hub run by the CDC during the flu season.
Our current system for generating forecasts can be found [here](https://github.com/cmu-delphi/flu-hosp-forecast/).
From these dozens of individual forecasts by various groups, the CDC publishes a weekly [ensemble prediction](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/flusight/flu-forecasts.htm).

### [COVID-19 Forecasting](https://covid19forecasthub.org/)

We participate in weekly COVID hospital admissions forecasting at the state and national level.
Our current system for generating forecasts will be available soon [here](https://github.com/cmu-delphi/covid-hosp-forecast).
In addition to publishing the individual forecasts from the participating groups, the Reich lab makes an ensemble prediction, and hosts a [visualization of both](https://viz.covid19forecasthub.org).
