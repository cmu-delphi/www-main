<p>With pandemic fatigue setting in across the United States after a long year
filled with uncertainty, many felt the temptation to celebrate a “normal”
Thanksgiving and Christmas. However, with cases steeply rising across the US,
the risk of transmission when gathering with friends and family only increased
throughout the fall. Many health organizations strongly discouraged large
gatherings during the holidays and a number of states expanded COVID-19
restrictions to prevent further escalation in cases.
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2020/12/21/christmas-flights-cdc-restrictions-covid/">Reports</a>
from airlines suggest air travel was up significantly during the holiday season,
but {{< reflink "surveys" "Delphi’s COVID-19 Surveys" >}} can
provide a broader picture of the travel Americans took during the holiday
season. In taking greater risks with travel, did Americans change their
behaviors in other preventative measures like mask wearing during this time?</p>
<p>For the following analyses, we use publicly available aggregate data from the
{{< apireflink "api/covidcast.html" "COVIDcast Epidata API" >}} that have
been {{< apireflink "api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.html#survey-weighting" "weighted to better match state demographics" >}}.
Here we focus on behavioral signals which have been available since September 8,
2020, when {{< reflink "2020-10-06-survey-wave-4" "Wave 4 of the survey was deployed" >}},
and are now visible in the {{< reflink "survey-results" "Delphi Group’s survey dashboard" >}}. Additionally, we
only consider data after November 11, 2020 to avoid any major effects due to the
US election on November 3. All data below will be based on 7-day rolling
averages of survey responses.</p>

<h2>Travel and Other Social Behaviors During US Holidays</h2>
<p>Despite <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays.html">warnings from the
CDC</a>
that the “safest way to celebrate is at home with people who live with you”, the
<a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2020/12/01/tsa-holiday-screening-volumes-tick-above-1m-several-days-during">TSA screened approximately 9.5 million airline
passengers</a>
during the 2020 Thanksgiving holiday travel period (about 35-45% of 2019 volumes
during the same time frame).
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2020/12/21/christmas-flights-cdc-restrictions-covid/">Reports</a>
from airlines suggested that travel reached its highest levels since the start
of the pandemic during the Christmas holiday with about 1% of the US population
taking flights in just the few days surrounding the holiday.</p>

<p>In the COVID-19 survey, we see an increase in self-reported out-of-state travel
in this time frame by surveyed adults. The figure above depicts the normalized
percent of survey respondents who recently traveled out-of-state for 4 US
regions (mean ± s.e. of states in region). Because different states have
different baseline travel behaviors, values in the above figure are relative to
out-of-state travel reported on November 11, 2020. While there was some
variation between states, it appears that out-of-state travel around
Thanksgiving and Christmas day (vertical gray dashed lines) rose steeply in all
regions in the US. We note that since we are using a 7-day average, a travel
peak on or very close to Thanksgiving day would show up 3 to 4 days later in our
data, which is what we observe.</p>
<p>While the increase in out-of-state travel appears dramatic during Thanksgiving,
the observed increase is less than the typical increase in travel around the
holiday. The <a href="https://www.bts.gov/archive/publications/america_on_the_go/us_holiday_travel/entire">Bureau of Transportation
Statistics</a>
notes that long distance trips (as defined by travel greater than 50 miles away)
usually increase by 54% in the 6 days surrounding Thanksgiving. In contrast, the
percentage increase in travel found in the survey was closer to 20%. For the
Christmas through New Years time period, the increase in individuals reporting
out-of-state travel in the survey is ~30%, which more closely matches prior year
estimates from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics of 23%. Overall though,
the out-of-state travel reported in the CSS is still down compared to earlier
months in the pandemic.</p>

<p>Through the survey, we also find that more people in many states spent time with
people outside of their household in social gatherings for Thanksgiving and
Christmas when compared to the preceding week. In the above figure, the percent
of surveyed adults who recently spent time with non-household members clearly
rises around the holidays for all 4 US regions (mean ± s.e. of states in
region).</p>
<p>Experts had suggested quarantining before the holiday to lower the risk of
spreading COVID-19 during family gatherings. We see a steady decrease in the
number of people reporting contact outside of the household in the 14 days
before Thanksgiving across all regions, possibly due to rising case counts
across the nation. However this strong trend is not observed for the Christmas
holiday. The Northeast and South show only very modest decreases in outside
contact in the days just before Christmas, and rates of contact outside the
household in the Midwest and West actually rose steadily during this time.
Overall, we don’t see strong evidence in the data of people proactively
quarantining between the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays to reduce the
potential for community spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Additionally, Thanksgiving and Christmas are major shopping holidays. When asked
if they had gone to the “market, grocery store, or pharmacy” in the past 24
hours, a high percentage of survey respondents responded they had on
Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and Christmas Day (mean ± s.e. of states in
region). Notably, there were steep falls in shopping in the following weeks,
perhaps as people instead chose to spend time indoors with their families.
Typically the days after Thanksgiving and Christmas are among the 10 busiest
in-store retail days of the year, though this trend does not necessarily extend
to grocery stores, pharmacies and the like. As such, the lack of evidence for
the typical post-holiday shopping binges likely reflects the specificity of the
survey question.</p>

<p>While people in the US may have traveled more, shopped more, and spent more time
with non-household members during the holidays, they also reported participating
in preventative measures in public to a greater degree. For example, the percent
of people who say they wore masks most or all of the time while in public in the
past 5 days increased across the nation prior to Thanksgiving and held steady
through the end of the year (mean ± s.e. of states in region).</p>
<p>Note, however, that this can’t be directly interpreted to mean that a certain
percentage of people wear masks in public places—the survey question asks
respondents if they wear masks <em>most</em> or all of the time in public, and since
mask usage is self-reported, it might be biased. A recent <a href="https://preventepidemics.org/covid19/science/weekly-science-review/january-9-15-2020/">Preventing Epidemics
comparison</a>
found that this self-reported data tends to give higher rates of mask use when
compared to direct observations of people in public places, such as through
surveillance cameras at stores, but also found that these direct observations
agree that mask use is increasing.</p>

<p>Several news agencies reported that the demand for COVID-19 tests <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-do-i-get-a-covid-19-test-before-thanksgiving-11605918004">surged before
Thanksgiving</a>.
While this was in large part due to rising COVID-19 cases nationwide, it is also
possible that many people chose to test before seeing friends or family during
the holidays. The CDC had urged Americans not to travel for the holidays, but
stated that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays.html">for those “who decide to travel, testing can help you do so more
safely.”</a>
In addition, several government agencies <a href="https://governor.nc.gov/news/north-carolina-provides-covid-19-tests-colleges-universities-across-state-support-testing">expanded
testing</a>
prior to the holiday season to support testing for people who elected to travel
and gather.</p>
<p>In the above figure, we do see an increase in survey respondents who had
recently been tested for COVID-19 prior to Thanksgiving, and a slight increase
before Christmas (mean ± s.e. of states in region). However, these effects are
fairly weak, and dominated by longer-term trends that likely reflect case count
trends in the region. For example, from mid-November through the end of the year
we see a ~20% fall in self-reported testing in the Midwest, probably an effect
of the <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/regional-cases-per-million">~50% decrease in COVID-19 cases in the
region</a> in the
same time period. We therefore see only weak evidence of prophylactic COVID-19
testing before the holidays.</p>
<p>Altogether, it is clear that many Americans opted to travel out-of-state and
gather with friends and family for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.
Public health experts provided a variety of recommendations to reduce the risks
associated with holiday celebrations. Unfortunately, the survey data does not
indicate widespread adherence to these guidelines, as we see only weak evidence
of preemptive quarantining or testing for safer holiday gatherings. Overall, our
analysis suggests conflicting pandemic behaviors during the 2020 holidays, where
a vast majority of Americans used preventative measures like mask-wearing in
public, but simultaneously increased the risk for disease spread by gathering
with friends and family, shopping more, and traveling out-of-state.</p>

<h2>See the Data Yourself!</h2>
<p>Since April 2020, Carnegie Mellon University’s Delphi Group and Facebook’s Data
for Good have partnered to conduct large-scale daily surveys to monitor the
spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. To date, the
survey has collected more than 50 million responses. In this post, we show how
the data from the {{< reflink "surveys" "COVID-19 survey" >}}
can be used to provide a broader picture of how American’s risk behaviors and
sentiments amidst a global pandemic.</p>
<p>All of the above plots were built using aggregate data for the United States
that CMU/Delphi Group &amp; Facebook provide to the public through the {{< apireflink "symptom-survey/" "COVIDcast Epidata API" >}}, and
visualize in the {{< reflink "/covidcast" "Delphi Group’s survey dashboard" >}}. Public, aggregate data for the
global COVID-19 survey can be accessed via <a href="https://covidmap.umd.edu/api.html">University of Maryland’s
API</a>. We encourage researchers, public health
officials, and the public to use the survey data and tools for their own
analyses. Microdata is also <a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/covid-19-symptom-survey-request-for-data-access/">available upon
