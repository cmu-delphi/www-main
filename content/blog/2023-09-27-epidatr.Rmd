  `epidatr` is designed to streamline the downloading and usage of data from the [Delphi Epidata API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/). It provides a simple R interface to the API, including functions for downloading data, parsing the results, and converting the data into a tidy format.

The [Delphi Epidata API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/) provides
real-time access to epidemiological surveillance data for influenza, COVID-19,
and other diseases from both official government sources such as the [Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/datastatistics/index.html), private partners such as
[Facebook (now
Meta)](https://delphi.cmu.edu/blog/2020/08/26/covid-19-symptom-surveys-through-facebook/)
and [Change Healthcare](https://www.changehealthcare.com/), and other public
datasets like [Google
Trends](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-datasets/covid19-search-trends).
It is built and maintained by the Carnegie Mellon University [Delphi Research
Group](https://delphi.cmu.edu/).

Today we introduce the R package `epidatr`, available [on
CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/epidatr/index.html), with the
source and development [on github](https://github.com/cmu-delphi/epidatr).

This package is designed to streamline the downloading and usage of data from
the Delphi Epidata API. It provides a simple R interface to the API, including
functions for downloading data, parsing the results, and converting the data
into a tidy format. The API stores a historical record of all data, including
corrections and updates, which is particularly useful for accurately backtesting
forecasting models. We also provide packages for downstream data processing
([epiprocess](https://github.com/cmu-delphi/epiprocess)) and modeling
([epipredict](https://github.com/cmu-delphi/epipredict)).

## Usage

```
library(epidatr)
# Obtain the smoothed covid-like illness (CLI) signal from Delphi's US COVID-19
# Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS), in partnership with Facebook, as it was on
# April 10, 2021 for the US at the national level
epidata <- pub_covidcast(
    source = "fb-survey",
    signals = "smoothed_cli",
    geo_type = "nation",
    time_type = "day",
    geo_values = "us",
    time_values = epirange(20210101, 20210601),
    as_of = 20210601
)
epidata
```

```

## Installation

Installing the package is straightforward.

```
# Install the CRAN version
pak::pkg_install("epidatr")

# Install the development version from the GitHub dev branch
pak::pkg_install("cmu-delphi/epidatr@dev")
```

### API Keys

The Delphi API requires a (free) API key for full functionality. To generate
your key, register for a pseudo-anonymous account
[here](https://api.delphi.cmu.edu/epidata/admin/registration_form) and see more
discussion on the [general API
website](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/api_keys.html). The
`epidatr` client will automatically look for this key in the environment
variable `DELPHI_EPIDATA_KEY`. We recommend storing your key in your `.Renviron`
file, which R will read by default.

Note that for the time being, the private endpoints (i.e. those prefixed with
`pvt`) will require a separate key that needs to be passed as an argument.

## For users of the covidcast R package

The `covidcast` package is deprecated and will no longer be updated. The
`epidatr` package is a complete rewrite of the [`covidcast`
package](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/), with a focus on
speed, reliability, and ease of use. It also supports more endpoints and data
sources than `covidcast`. When migrating from that package, you will need to use
the
[`pub_covidcast`](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epidatr/reference/pub_covidcast.html)
function in `epidatr`.
