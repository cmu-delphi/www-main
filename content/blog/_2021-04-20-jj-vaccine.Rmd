As the United States races to vaccinate its residents, allowing COVID
restrictions to loosen and much of normal life to resume, it's crucial that
everyone is confident in the COVID vaccines and willing to receive them. That's
why it was concerning when, on April 13th, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration
[announced](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/joint-cdc-and-fda-statement-johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine)
their recommendation to pause use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine until they
can investigate severe blood clots developed by several women after they
received the vaccine. This followed news reports of adverse effects reported
several days earlier. Though all signs suggest the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines
-- which make up the bulk of the US's doses -- are safe, and the blood clots are
being carefully investigated, it would be unfortunate if this incident lowers
public confidence in vaccine.

Some polls already suggest [the public is now less confident in the Johnson &
Johnson
vaccine](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2021/04/15/johnson-johnson-vaccine-confidence),
but it's difficult to track changes over time with most polls, and to put the
changes into context. That's why the Delphi Group has been tracking COVID
vaccination using its [COVID Symptom
Survey](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/surveys/), a massive survey distributed
daily across the United States through our partnership with Facebook. We've
successfully used this survey to track
`r blogdown::shortcode_html("reflink", "2021-01-22-holiday-surveys", "social distancing")` and
`r blogdown::shortcode_html("reflink", "2020-12-10-masks-public", "mask use")`, and
it's part of Delphi's COVID forecasting system.

Since the beginning of January 2021, we have asked all respondents about whether
they have been vaccinated, whether they'd be willing to be vaccinated, and any
reasons they may choose not to be vaccinated -- and because the survey is taken
by nearly 40,000 respondents per day, we can detect sudden changes and make
geographic comparisons across the United States.

The good news is that, while there may be a temporary setback, we don't see
major changes in vaccine hesitancy yet. But our data also suggests this is the
time for action -- that public health officials must work to earn public trust
and boost confidence in COVID vaccines, and must do so quickly.

## National changes in vaccine acceptance

Let's start with vaccine acceptance. We ask respondents whether they are already
vaccinated; if not, we ask whether they would accept a vaccine if one was
offered to them today. If we count everyone who either is already vaccinated or
is willing to be, then among `r prettyNum(sum(!is.na(d$vaccinated_or_accept)),
big.mark=",")` survey responses, we see a consistent increasing trend that stops
as the news broke, followed by a delay of a few days and a recovery:

```{r uptake-acceptance, fig.height=4}
d %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(vaccinated_or_accept = weighted.mean(vaccinated_or_accept, weight,
                                                 na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = vaccinated_or_accept)) %>%
  axes_me_up() +
  labs(y = "Vaccinated or accepting",
       title = "Vaccine uptake and acceptance in the US")
```

The red lines mark April 9th, when some of the first reports of adverse effects
made it onto the news, and April 13th, when the CDC and FDA issued their
recommendation to suspend the vaccine. The resulting dip in acceptance lasted a
few days before rates returned to their previous levels. But note the *Y* axis
scale: we're looking at a change of **around 1 percentage point**, which is only
noticeable because of the size of our survey. While it is not yet clear if
acceptance will resume its upward trend or if we've reached a ceiling, it is
reassuring that it has not dramatically fallen.

But these numbers don't tell the whole story. It's more useful to look at the
reasons for hesitancy. When respondents say they probably or definitely would
not choose to get vaccinated, we also ask them to select from a list of possible
reasons. We might expect an increase in the number of respondents indicating
concern about side effects as a reason, and we might also expect a larger
increase among women -- since the early blood clots all affected women. But
among all respondents (counting those already vaccinated as not having side
effect-related hesitancy), the percentage who are unwilling to get vaccinated
and indicate side effects as a cause shows only a small bump:

```{r side-effect-hesitancy, fig.height=4, message=FALSE}
d %>%
  filter(gender == "Female" | gender == "Male") %>%
  group_by(date, gender) %>%
  summarize(
    side_effects = weighted.mean(
      ifelse(V1 == 1 | V3 == 1 | V3 == 2, 0,
             is_selected(hesitancy_reasons_logic, "1")),
      weight, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = side_effects, color = gender)) %>%
  axes_me_up(accuracy = 0.1) +
  labs(y = "Hesitant and concerned about side effects",
       title = "Hesitancy related to concern about vaccine side effects",
       subtitle = "Among all respondents, nationally",
       color = "Gender")
```

The bump is larger among men than women, although the difference is quite small
(around half a percentage point) and could easily reflect measurement error
rather than a true difference.

Now let's look just at unvaccinated respondents. Concerns about side effects
have consistently been one of the most common reasons unvaccinated respondents
give for hesitancy, even before the announcement:

```{r}
pre_post_table(d, "Frequency of hesitancy reasons among unvaccinated respondents",
               "Before and after J&J vaccine pause, nationally",
               include_unvaccinated = TRUE)
```

As you can see, each reason has been increasing over time. (Respondents can
select multiple reasons from a list of about 15, so the numbers do not add to
100%.) But that is **what we would expect to happen** in normal circumstances:
As more people get vaccinated, the people who remain unvaccinated are those who
either don't want to be vaccinated or haven't yet been able to.

Given the other reasons commonly selected -- a lack of trust in the vaccines and
the government, a preference to wait and see if the vaccines are safe -- the
concerns about side effects are likely part of the common concern that the COVID
vaccines are unsafe because they were developed very quickly. Those concerns
predate the Johnson & Johnson vaccine announcement. The largest increases are
among choices about side effects and trust in the vaccines, suggesting the
announcement may have exacerbated existing concerns among people skeptical of
the vaccines.

Hesitancy and concerns about side effects are also not distributed evenly across
the United States, instead being concentrated in southern and southwestern
states like Louisiana, South Carolina, and New Mexico, as well as north-central
states like Wyoming, North Dakota, and Montana:

```{r side-effect-hesitancy-map}
d %>%
  filter(date >= "2021-04-14") %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(
    side_effects = 100 * weighted.mean(
      ifelse(V3 == 1 | V3 == 2, 0,
             is_selected(hesitancy_reasons_logic, "1")),
      weight, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(state = tolower(state),
         time_value = "2021-04-13") %>%
  rename(geo_value = state, value = side_effects) %>%
  as.covidcast_signal(signal = "side-effects", geo_type = "state") %>%
  plot(plot_type = "choro", range = c(10, 45)) +
  labs(title = "Hesitancy related to concerns about side effects",
       subtitle = "Among unvaccinated respondents, April 14-21",
       caption = "Data from Delphi COVIDcast, delphi.cmu.edu")
```

This disparity across the country suggests that concerns about side effects are
not just driven by the news. They're partly driven by longstanding demographic
and historical differences, and as [other researchers have
noted](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-what-weve-learned-april-2021/),
"no group is monolithic in their vaccine attitudes, and in every demographic
segment there are large shares of people who are ready to get the vaccine,
others who are in “wait and see” mode, and some who are more resistant." There
is hence no magic solution, only thoughtful and considerate approaches that work
to earn the trust of each potential vaccine recipient.

## Who would respondents trust?

This, of course, raises a question: What would convince hesitant people to get
vaccinated? What messages work best, delivered by whom? But while our survey
helps us understand their reasoning, it doesn't say how best to convince them --
after all, it's hard to ask a survey respondent "Tell us the best way to change
your mind." There are some steps that are clearly necessary, such as a thorough
and public investigation of any adverse effects so they can be understood and
prevented. But our survey doesn't directly say what information should be
provided to the public.

Other researchers have been studying the reasons people are hesitant in more
depth, to better understand the messaging that would convince them. For example,
Surgo Ventures has developed [a grouping of hesitancy
reasons](https://surgoventures.org/newsroom-all/analysis-surgo-projects-us-covid-19-vaccination-rates-will-plateau-in-late-april),
so messaging can be targeted separately to "the watchful" -- those who want to
wait and see if the vaccines are safe -- and to other groups like those anxious
about medical costs or those who distrust the system. We're currently working to
expand our survey to facilitate this analysis at a national scale.

We also ask *who* respondents would trust to recommend COVID vaccines to them.
We ask all unvaccinated respondents "Would you be more or less likely to get a
COVID-19 vaccination if it were recommended to you by each of the following?"
Looking just at respondents who are concerned about side effects, here's what we
see:

```{r}
sef <- d %>%
  filter(is_selected(hesitancy_reasons_logic, "1"))

count_responses <- function(data, var) {
  var <- enquo(var)

  data %>%
    filter(!is.na(!!var)) %>%
    group_by(!!var) %>%
    summarize(sum_weights = sum(weight)) %>%
    mutate(sum_weights = sum_weights / sum(sum_weights)) %>%
    arrange(!!var) %>%
    pull(sum_weights)
}

responses <- as.data.frame(rbind(
  count_responses(sef, V4_1),
  count_responses(sef, V4_2),
  count_responses(sef, V4_3),
  count_responses(sef, V4_4),
  count_responses(sef, V4_5)
))

names(responses) <- c("more", "same", "less")

responses$group <- c("Friends and family",
                     "Doctors and other health professionals you go to for medical care",
                     "World Health Organization",
                     "Government health officials",
                     "Politicians")

responses %>%
  arrange(desc(more)) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header("How recommedations by different sources would change vaccine intent",
             "Among respondents hesitant because of concerns about side effects") %>%
  cols_move_to_start("group") %>%
  cols_label(group = "Source",
             more = "More likely",
             same = "About the same",
             less = "Less likely") %>%
  fmt_percent(columns = c("more", "same", "less"),
              decimals = 0)
```

It seems most respondents don't anticipate anyone changing their minds -- but
if anyone did, it would be the healthcare providers they already trust, or their
own friends and family members. This suggests strategies that involve enlisting
the support of primary care doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers
across the country who see patients regularly, know their histories, and
understand their concerns about vaccines. And these results certainly suggest
that announcements by politicians would achieve little among people already
skeptical of vaccines and the government.

## Limitations

As with any scientific study, there are limitations to the results seen above.
Here are a few important things to keep in mind:

* **We're surveying Facebook users.** While we [weight survey
  responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14675) to ensure their age and gender
  distribution matches the United States population, our respondents do tend to
  be more educated than the national average, which the weights do not correct
  for.
* **The survey is voluntary.** Facebook draws a random sample of active users
  every day and invites them to take the survey via a promotion in their News
  Feed. Many people don't respond to the invitation, and while the
  Facebook-provided survey weights attempt to account for this by using models
  to predict the probability each user will respond, there may still be
  unobserved biases remaining.
* **Survey responses are simplifications.** Our respondents can select reasons
  for hesitancy from a list, but ticking boxes can't fully represent the
  complexity of their beliefs and the reasons for their lack of trust in COVID
  vaccines. Also, their responses may not always match their behavior: a
  respondent who says they "probably wouldn't" get vaccinated may decide to get
  vaccinated when a dose is offered to them, and a respondent who "definitely
  would" get vaccinated might change their mind.

One result of these biases is that our estimate of the percent of Americans who
have already received a COVID vaccine is too high when compared against official
CDC data. So while our survey can detect changes over time, it's possible
there's a consistent upwards bias to some of our vaccine uptake and acceptance
estimates. Fortunately our results, and particularly the prominent role of
concerns about side effects from vaccines, match well with [results from other
surveys conducted with nationally representative
samples](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-rural-america/).

## Conclusions

Based on survey responses from hundreds of thousands of Facebook users, we do
not see evidence that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine pause has caused major
changes in public willingness to get vaccinated. While there have been some
shifts, they're relatively small and connect to existing skepticism about the
safety of the COVID vaccines. To expand acceptance of COVID vaccines, public
health officials will need a combination of approaches and a good understanding
of the reasons people are hesitant. Surveys like ours can help target this work
and track progress, but it will take much more than just surveys to reach out to
all Americans and ensure they both have access to vaccines and the willingness
to receive them.

Nonetheless, this demonstrates the value of Delphi's [COVID Symptom
Surveys](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/surveys/) for studying public
attitudes and behavior during the pandemic. In partnership with Facebook, who
help us distribute the surveys, and the University of Maryland, who run [an
international version](https://covidmap.umd.edu/) in 56 languages worldwide, we
have been able to track the pandemic and its effects on society for over a year
now. And much of our data is easily accessible to researchers, through
aggregates in the [Delphi COVIDcast Epidata
API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.html)
and [tables available for
download](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/symptom-survey/contingency-tables.html),
and as de-identified individual responses for [researchers who sign Data Use
Agreements](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/symptom-survey/data-access.html).
With so many responses daily, we can react quickly and spot local changes. If
you're conducting COVID-related research, we encourage you to explore the data
and see how it can help you.
