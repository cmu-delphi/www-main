<p>The COVID-19 Symptom Survey, which is conducted by the Delphi Group in
partnership with Facebook Data for Good, is one of the largest COVID-19 data
collection efforts in the United States. To date, over 16 million responses have
been collected since its launch in April 2020. Using the Symptom Survey, we have
been able to track and inform trends on

<h2>New Vaccine Surveillance Module</h2>
<p>In support of the COVID-19 vaccination campaigns that are currently underway
across the country, we collaborated with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) to incorporate several vaccine surveillance questions that
enable our survey to track vaccination uptake and measure vaccine-related
sentiments as the states plan and progress through the different phases of the
federal priority criteria and their own vaccination programs. We aimed to
address the following critical public health topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How many people are vaccinated? Of those who are vaccinated, how many received
the complete set of doses?</p></li>
<li><p>How many people are hesitant about getting vaccinated? Why? How many are
worried about experiencing a side effect?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there barriers to accessing either vaccinations or information about
vaccinations?</p></li>
<li><p>Would people be more likely to get vaccinated if it were recommended to them
by certain information sources?</p></li>
<li><p>How do the responses to these questions vary by sociodemographic status such
as occupation, age, gender, and race or ethnicity? How do these vary by
clinical risk factors?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Though a few of these questions are not yet incorporated into our survey, the
Symptom Survey now includes daily responses that can be used to answer many of
these questions. The other items will be incorporated soon, so stay tuned and
check back here!</p>

<h2>Insights from the Symptom Survey’s COVID-19 Vaccination Data</h2>
<p>As COVID-19 vaccination programs ramp up across the country, we can use data
from the Symptom Survey to estimate percentages of individuals who report having
been vaccinated. We used 300,000 survey responses received between January 9th
and January 15th to calculate the percentage of respondents in each state who
say they have received a COVID-19 vaccination, shown below:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-01-28-survey-vaccines_files/vaccine_blog_uptake_overall.svg" /></p>
<p>The map suggests that the estimated proportion of individuals vaccinated is
highest in some states in the midwestern, southern, and northeastern regions,
which is a similar pattern to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/">what is shown in CDC vaccine dose administration
data</a>.
Alaska and West Virginia also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/us/west-virginia-vaccine.html">stand
out</a> with some
of the highest per capita self-reported vaccination rates.</p>
<p>This signal may differ from CDC data on vaccine administration across the U.S.
because of survey biases combined with lag in official reporting and should not
be treated as authoritative. We will continue to assess these biases as we collect
more data. To establish confidence in the insights from the survey, we conducted a
simple correlation analysis between the most recently available survey data and the
official <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days">CDC vaccine data</a>.
We found a correlation of 0.83 between the survey’s self-reported vaccine uptake and
the CDC’s reported number of people with 1+ doses per 100K. This gives confidence that
the survey aligns with official data and that the unique, granular insights showcased
match reality.</p>
<p>One of the unique values of our survey is that we are able to further break down the
percentages by population subgroups, such as various race and ethnicity
groups, which is important for policymakers to consider given the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2769837">health and
vaccination
disparities</a> that
exist by race and ethnicity. In the figures below, we illustrate how
self-reported vaccination rates vary by racial and ethnic groups.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-01-28-survey-vaccines_files/vaccine_blog_uptake_race.svg" /></p>
<p>There seems to be a large variation in self-reported vaccination by race and
ethnicity: We observe the highest rates among Asians and American Indians or
Alaska Natives, and the lowest rates among the Black or African American group.
The high uptake among American Indians or Alaska Natives is particularly
noteworthy, as it corroborates the efficient widespread vaccination rollouts by
the <a href="https://www.ihs.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/2020-press-releases/ihs-releases-covid-19-pandemic-vaccine-plan-november-2020/">Indian Health
Service</a>.</p>
<p>We are also able to further examine disparities across the states in our data.
Below, we illustrate how self-reported vaccination rates for Black individuals
compare to White individuals:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-01-28-survey-vaccines_files/vaccine_blog_uptake_black_to_white.svg" /></p>
<p>While we are not currently able to make comparisons for all states due to a
small sample size of Black respondents in several states that prevents aggregate
reporting, we observe that for most of the remaining states, the estimated
percentages of vaccinations are lower among Black adults compared to White
adults, with most states showing a relative ratio less than 1, meaning a lower
likelihood of self-reported vaccinations among Black adults compared to White
adults. As we make comparisons using these data, we should acknowledge that
vaccinations are currently being prioritized among healthcare workers and older
individuals, so the trends that we observe today may not necessarily be what we
observe once vaccinations reach other population groups.</p>
</div>
<div id="vaccine-uptake-among-priority-groups" class="section level2">
<h2>Vaccine Uptake Among Priority Groups</h2>
<p>State and local health authorities are currently allocating the COVID vaccine
first to certain priority groups, taking into consideration
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm695152e2.htm">recommendations</a> by the
CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. For most states, the
priority groups currently include healthcare workers and those over age 65 or
75.</p>
<p>Using survey responses from early January, we used the Symptom Survey to examine
estimated vaccination rates among healthcare workers and people age 65 and
older. For several months, the survey has been asking a few questions related to
occupation, so we classified respondents as healthcare workers if they indicated
that their job can be categorized as either “healthcare practitioner or
technician” or “healthcare support”. (This includes, doctors, nurses,
pharmacists, dentists, technicians, and many related fields.) Below, we depict
1) self-reported vaccination rates among the priority groups, 2) differences in
the percentages by gender, and 3) differences in the percentages by race and
ethnicity groups.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-01-28-survey-vaccines_files/vaccine_blog_priority_by_gender.svg" /></p>
<p>Self-reported vaccination rates are higher among healthcare workers than among
individuals aged 65+ years, which is reasonable given that they were the first
group to be given priority. When comparing by gender, the proportions are
slightly higher for men compared to women, and this difference is more prominent
among healthcare workers.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-01-28-survey-vaccines_files/vaccine_blog_priority_by_race.svg" /></p>
<p>We also notice a consistent trend in self-reported vaccination rates when broken
down by race and ethnicity: the rate among the Black or African American group
is consistently lower than other groups such as White and Asian. This is
<a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2020.305990">consistent with
research</a> on
health disparities during the COVID pandemic and many years of disparities long
before it, highlighting the importance of actions to reduce disparity in
healthcare and access.</p>
<p>(<em>Note that when a race and ethnicity group is missing in the figures, it does
not necessarily indicate the absence of the group among our respondents; it is
more likely that there are too few responses among that group for aggregated
reporting in a given area.</em>)</p>
</div>
<div id="vaccine-acceptance" class="section level2">
<h2>Vaccine Acceptance</h2>
<p>There are still many who have not yet received a vaccination in the U.S.,
including among priority groups. This raises the question: of those not yet
vaccinated, how many are willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccination? We mapped
the estimated proportion of vaccine acceptance, which is defined here as
<em>definitely</em> or <em>probably</em> choosing to receive a COVID-19 vaccination if it were
offered to them today.</p>
<p>We find that in most states, the majority of people are vaccine-accepting, and
that the highest acceptance rates are observed in states in the western,
midwestern, and northeastern regions (see figure below). While researchers are
not yet certain about the proportion of the population that should be vaccinated
to reach <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19">herd
immunity</a>
against COVID-19, our data on vaccine acceptance and uptake still provide
valuable insights into where and who we can better target to improve
vaccine-related sentiments.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-01-28-survey-vaccines_files/vaccine_blog_acceptance_overall.svg" /></p>
<p>Similar to what we have observed with self-reported vaccination rates, our data
depict a wide range of vaccine acceptance by race and ethnicity groups (shown
below). This disparity is similar to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2769837">what has been seen previously for other
vaccines</a>, and is
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html">likely the result of many
factors</a>:
in particular, in the United States, minority groups are less likely to have
affordable access to healthcare, and decades of discriminatory treatment have
reduced their trust in medicine.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-01-28-survey-vaccines_files/vaccine_blog_acceptance_race.svg" /></p>
</div>
<div id="increasing-the-likelihood-of-vaccination" class="section level2">
<h2>Increasing the Likelihood of Vaccination</h2>
<p>Our new survey data shows not only the prevalence of self-reported vaccination
uptake and acceptance, but also how we may be able to improve
vaccination-related messaging. One of the questions that we ask on our survey
is, “Would you be more or less likely to get a COVID-19 vaccination if it were
recommended to you by each of the following? Friends or family, local healthcare
providers, World Health Organization (WHO), politicians, or government health
officials” (adapted from the <a href="https://covidsurvey.mit.edu/">MIT COVID-19
Survey</a>).</p>
<p>With this information, we are able to examine which of the five sources of
information may be trusted more by individuals who have not yet reported getting
vaccinated. Below, we break down the responses by two groups of respondents:
those who are vaccine-accepting (i.e., indicated that they are <em>definitely</em> or
<em>probably</em> choosing to get vaccinated) and those who are vaccine-hesitant (i.e.,
indicated that they are <em>definitely not</em> or <em>probably not</em> choosing to get
vaccinated).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-01-28-survey-vaccines_files/vaccine_blog_priority_trust.svg" /></p>
<p>Interestingly, but perhaps not surprisingly, there seems to be a large
difference in responses between the vaccine-accepting and vaccine-hesitant
groups. We find that among individuals who have not yet been vaccinated
(self-reported), those who are vaccine-hesitant are much less likely to get
vaccinated based on recommendations in general compared to the vaccine-accepting
group.</p>
<p>Among those who are vaccine-accepting, they are more likely to get vaccinated if
the recommendations come from more authoritative sources like the World Health
Organization (WHO), local healthcare workers, or government health officials.
Those who are vaccine-hesitant are less likely to report that they would get
vaccinated in general; however, they also seem to trust their local healthcare
workers the most as a vaccine-related information source. Interestingly, this
group is also more likely to take recommendations from friends or family members
than from the WHO or government health officials. Taken together, our results
can be used to inform how policymakers and health organizations should leverage
various information sources in future messaging campaigns to potentially
increase vaccine acceptance and ultimately, vaccine uptake.</p>
</div>
<div id="concerns-about-side-effects" class="section level2">
<h2>Concerns About Side Effects</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/programs.html">To improve and sustain high vaccination
rates</a>,
it will also be critical to understand potential barriers to uptake or reasons
for vaccine hesitancy. One major barrier may be concerns related to side
effects, and we can track the percentages of those who may be concerned about
side effects using one of our newly-added questions: <em>“How concerned are you
that you would experience a side effect from a COVID-19 vaccination?”</em></p>
<p>When we examine the state-level estimated percentages (shown in the figure
below), we find that the proportion of those who are very or somewhat worried
about side effects vary from 30% to 50% in the U.S., and we observe the highest
rates concentrated in the South.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-01-28-survey-vaccines_files/vaccine_blog_concern_sideeffects.svg" /></p>
<p>Based on our earlier results demonstrating differences in vaccination rates and
acceptance by race and ethnicity, we also illustrate below how concerns about
side effects compare between Black and White adults.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-01-28-survey-vaccines_files/vaccine_blog_concern_sideeffects_bw.svg" /></p>
<p>In all of the states with adequate survey sample sizes for both Black and White
respondents, we find that Black individuals are consistently more likely to
worry about experiencing a side effect compared to White individuals, as
indicated by relative ratios that are greater than 1 (meaning a higher
likelihood of worrying about a side effect). In fact, in some states, this ratio
reaches 2, which means that Black adults are twice as likely to worry about
experiencing a side effect compared to White adults When we further break down
this comparison by vaccine acceptance/hesitancy (see the figure below), we find
that Black individuals are always more likely to be concerned about experiencing
side effects compared to White individuals, regardless of being
vaccine-accepting or vaccine-hesitant. Future research is warranted to better
understand how we can address these concerns in various subpopulation groups and
if addressing concerns related to side effects can lead to higher vaccination
rates.</p>

<div id="how-you-can-analyze-this-data" class="section level2">
<h2>How You Can Analyze This Data</h2>
<p>In this post, we provided an introduction and an overview of the
vaccination-related data that are available in the COVID Symptom Survey and how
we can use the data to answer important public health questions related to
vaccinations. There are, however, many more questions that you can help answer.
For example, how do self-reported vaccinations and vaccination-related
sentiments change over time? How do these change in response to guidelines and
public health interventions? Is vaccine hesitancy associated with other
behavioral measures or social activities? How is your local community responding
to all of the vaccination-related efforts? You can answer all of these and more
by analyzing these data!</p>

<div id="privacy-statement" class="section level2">
<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>This survey was designed with privacy in mind from the start. Carnegie Mellon
University and the University of Maryland do not share individual survey
responses with Facebook, and while Facebook recruits participants to the survey,
participants can’t be linked back to their Facebook profiles. When non-aggregated
survey data is shared with eligible academic and nonprofit institutions, Facebook
shares a single statistic known as a weight value, which doesn’t identify a person but
helps researchers correct for any sample bias. This helps ensure that the survey
sample more accurately reflects the characteristics of the population represented
in the data.</p>
