As COVID cases and deaths continue to rise in the United States, we are
repeatedly reminded that unless we take the appropriate precautions---by wearing
masks when around other people, working from home whenever possible, and
avoiding travel and crowded places---there will be a high rate of COVID deaths.
Vaccines are on their way, but until they arrive, we must continue social
distancing.

But after all the precautions we've taken and the sacrifices we have made in our
lives during 2020, we have seen many people ask: Why haven't these precautions
prevented the current COVID spike? Some have even argued that this is proof that
masks and social distancing do not work. Can this claim be justified?

To answer this question, we must first ask: *Is* everyone wearing masks? And are
they also socially distancing in other ways? In this post, we'll show how
Delphi's COVID symptom surveys can help answer these questions and how they can
enable important research about the pandemic and its spread.

## Studying Mask Use with Surveys

Since April, and in partnership with Facebook Data for Good and the University
of Maryland, Delphi has [conducted daily surveys of Facebook
users](`r blogdown::shortcode_html("ref", "2020-08-26-fb-survey")`)
throughout the United States. These surveys ask respondents about their
experiences during the pandemic, and ask whether they're experiencing symptoms,
whether they are isolating or following precautions, and how they have been
affected by the pandemic. They survey has been completed over 14 million times
since April, allowing us an unprecedented level of insight into COVID and
people's experiences, down to individual counties around the country.

[Since early
September](`r blogdown::shortcode_html("ref", "2020-10-06-survey-wave-4")`)
we have asked all respondents a question about mask use:

> In the past 5 days, how often did you wear a mask when in public?
>
> 1. All the time
> 2. Most of the time
> 3. Some of the time
> 4. A little of the time
> 5. None of the time
> 6. I have not been in public during the past 5 days

Early analysis suggests that mask usage is high in most states, and in those
where it was lower, it has been gradually increasing. For example, the graph
below shows the percentage of respondents who answer "Most of the time" or "All
of the time" in six states (including DC). In three of these (the District of
Columbia, Massachusetts, and New York), mask usage is among the highest in the
country; in the other three (South Dakota, Idaho, and Wyoming), it's among the
lowest.

```{r state_masks_time, message=FALSE}
library(covidcast)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(directlabels)

states_of_interest <- c("dc", "ma", "ny", "wy", "sd", "id")

state_masks <- covidcast_signal(
  "fb-survey", "smoothed_wwearing_mask",
  start_day = "2020-09-15", end_day = "2020-12-05",
  geo_type = "state", geo_values = states_of_interest
)

ggplot(state_masks, aes(x = time_value, y = value, color = geo_value)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_dl(aes(label = toupper(geo_value)), method = "last.bumpup") +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month",
               date_labels = "%b %Y",
               date_minor_breaks = "1 week") +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "% wearing masks in public most/all the time",
       title = "Self-reported public mask usage",
       subtitle = "From Delphi's surveys, conducted through Facebook",
       caption = "Data from Delphi COVIDcast, delphi.cmu.edu") +
  theme_bw() +
  guides(color = FALSE)
```

Despite the gap between states, it also seems clear that self-reported mask use
has been on the rise in states whose mask use started low. This is quite
encouraging.

(Note that, as with most of Delphi's blog posts, all the code and data used to
make these plots is available---simply click the Code button to see how our [API
clients](`r blogdown::shortcode_html("apiref", "api/covidcast_clients.html")`)
make it easy to access aggregated data.)

Seeing these numbers---particularly the very high reported mask usage in many
states---might make you wonder: If mask usage is over 80% in most states and
over 90% in many, why does the rate of new COVID cases in the United States
currently look like this?

```{r national_cases_time, message=FALSE}
cases <- covidcast_signal("indicator-combination",
                          "confirmed_7dav_incidence_num",
                          start_day = "2020-09-15", end_day = "2020-12-05",
                          geo_type = "state")

cases %>%
  group_by(time_value) %>%
  summarize(cases = sum(value)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time_value, y = cases)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month",
               date_labels = "%b %Y",
               date_minor_breaks = "1 week") +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Reported new cases",
       title = "Number of reported new cases per day",
       subtitle = "7-day rolling average",
       caption = "Data from Delphi COVIDcast, delphi.cmu.edu") +
  theme_bw()
```

To answer this important question, we must ask:

1. Do the surveys reliably measure mask use in public? If they are biased in
   some way, perhaps mask use is not as common as they suggest.
2. How much mask use is necessary to prevent cases? If some people do not wear
   masks and interact with each other, they may spread COVID. Also, masks
   *reduce* risk; [they do not eliminate
   it](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202004.0203/v4). If people are
   working indoors around others, hosting social events, dining indoors, and so
   on, but wearing masks, they are nonetheless at greater risk than people who
   do none of those things.

## Potential Survey Biases

To answer the first question, we must consider what kinds of biases could affect
the surveys:

* **Sampling bias.** Survey respondents are sampled from Facebook users, but
  Facebook users may not be representative of the United States population.
  Facebook [produces survey weights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14675) designed
  to help us adjust the survey to match the population's age and gender
  distribution, but there could be other factors besides age and gender that
  differ between Facebook users and the United States population generally.
* **Non-response bias.** The survey is voluntary---recruited users are shown an
  invitation in their News Feed but can opt not to click on it---and so people
  who take the survey might be different in some way. For example, perhaps the
  people who take the survey are more concerned about COVID than those who
  choose not to, and hence are more likely to wear masks than the general
  population. Facebook's weights try to account for this by estimating the
  probability that each person will respond, but it's difficult to verify that
  this probability is estimated correctly.
* **Social desirability bias.** It's well-known that survey respondents can
  prefer answers that seem socially desirable. If mask usage is widely accepted
  and there is immense social pressure to comply, someone who does not usually
  wear a mask may feel pressure to say they do on a survey. This effect is
  likely smaller on an anonymous online survey than it would be in person, but
  it could still be present.
* **Incorrect responses.** Some survey respondents may deliberately give
  incorrect answers because when you post something on the Internet, inevitably
  someone will try to mess with it. Sometimes this is easy to detect (e.g.,
  people indicating that they are experiencing *every* symptom of a list of 16
  or that they have -20 family members), but not always.

These biases are hard to measure directly. There's another problem too: If 90%
of people say they wear masks when they're in public, that doesn't mean that 90%
of people in public places are wearing masks! For example, if people who wear
masks also tend to limit the amount of time they spend in public places, while
people who do not wear masks spend more time in public, people in public may be
more likely to also be people who don't wear masks.

We don't have a way to tell if a respondent is truthful, and since there's no
objective national data on the exact percentage of people wearing masks in
public, we have no way to check exactly how biased results could be. We have
seen hints, however: when researchers in Philadelphia [studied surveillance
camera footage to count how many people in public places wear masks
correctly](https://bloombergcities.medium.com/how-philadelphia-is-cracking-the-code-for-measuring-mask-compliance-7ace18daa9a9),
only 43% did, despite over 90% of Philadelphia respondents to our survey saying
they wear masks most or all of the time. Unfortunately this is only one study in
one city, and doesn't give us a picture of mask usage nationally.

After consulting with survey experts, we chose a different way to check our mask
use estimates. In late November, we added a new mask question to the survey:

> In the past 7 days, when out in public places where social distancing is not
> possible, about how many people would you estimate wore masks?
>
> 1. All of the people were wearing masks
> 2. Most of the people were wearing masks
> 3. Some of the people were wearing masks
> 4. A few of the people were wearing masks
> 5. None of the people were wearing masks
> 6. I have not been out in public places in the past 7 days

Because this question asks about *other* people, it bypasses social desirability
bias. And even if the survey sample is not representative, as long as the
respondents visit representative public places (like grocery stores or public
transit) and see *other* people there, we may get a better estimate of public
mask use.

Let's see how the data looks. We'll plot the percentage of people answering
"all" or "most" to each mask question in each state:

```{r mask_questions_compared, message=FALSE}
masked <- covidcast_signal("fb-survey", "smoothed_wwearing_mask",
                           start_day = "2020-12-01", end_day = "2020-12-01",
                           geo_type = "state")
other_mask <- covidcast_signal("fb-survey", "smoothed_wothers_masked",
                               start_day = "2020-12-01", end_day = "2020-12-01",
                               geo_type = "state")

joined <- masked %>%
    inner_join(other_mask, by = "geo_value", suffix = c(".self", ".other"))

ggplot(joined, aes(x = value.self, y = value.other,
                   label = toupper(geo_value))) +
  geom_text() +
  labs(x = "% who report wearing masks most/all the time",
       y = "% who report most/all others wear masks",
       title = "Mask use reported in symptom survey",
       subtitle = "December 1st, 2020",
       caption = "Data from Delphi COVIDcast, delphi.cmu.edu") +
  theme_bw()
```

There are a few things worthy of note. There is clearly a strong relationship
here---but notice that in South Dakota and Wyoming, where over 80% report they
wear masks most or all of the time, **fewer than half** of respondents agree that
most or all *other* people wear masks in public places. Only in a few states do
over 90% of respondents agree that most other people wear masks:

```{r}
joined %>%
  filter(value.other >= 90) %>%
  arrange(desc(value.other)) %>%
  select(geo_value, value.other) %>%
  mutate(geo_value = abbr_to_name(geo_value, ignore.case = TRUE)) %>%
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("State", "% agree that most/all others are masked"),
               digits = 1)
```

But we should also be careful in interpreting this. In South Dakota and Wyoming,
fewer than half of respondents agree that most or all other people wear masks.
We can conclude that it's clearly untrue that "everyone wears masks", but this
is not the same thing as saying that fewer than half of people wear masks. For
example, if people interpret "most people wear masks" to mean "I only see one or
two people not wearing masks when I'm in public", "most" could correspond to 80
or 90% mask use, rather than just 50%. It's not obvious how to translate the
survey question into an estimate of the percent of people wearing masks. So what
can we learn from this?

## A Probabilistic Argument for Mask Use

Permit me to discuss some probability theory for a moment. It's fine if you
don't follow the math---the key point will be the probability it allows me to
calculate two paragraphs from now.

Suppose that the true proportion of people who wear masks in public in a certain
state is $p$. Suppose those people are uniformly distributed throughout the
state. If you go out in a public place and see 20 people, the number of those
people who are wearing masks is a random variable $X$ with distribution
$\text{Binomial}(20, p)$.

Suppose $p = 0.8$, meaning 80% of people wear masks. With a bit of math, we
find that on a typical trip into public, the chance of seeing **at least 4
people** not wearing masks is $\Pr(X \leq 16)$, or
**`r round(pbinom(3, size=20, prob=0.2, lower.tail = FALSE) * 100)`%.** To
reduce that chance to 10%, we'd need 91% mask compliance, showing how small
changes in mask usage can cause big changes in risk.

This means that the apparent contradiction we saw in the graph above---with
respondents claiming that they wear masks but disputing that most others
do---may not be a contradiction. Depending on how respondents interpret "most",
it might be expected. After all, if you wear a mask yourself but then run into
four different people who do not while getting groceries, you could be quite
justified in denying that "most" people wear masks.

But more importantly, this shows **why a high rate of mask use is so
important.** If 80% of people wear masks, you are still likely to run into
several unmasked people on a trip to any public place, placing you at higher
risk. The problem only gets worse if our assumption that mask use is uniformly
distributed is false, and if people without masks tend to visit the same
locations or events, or gather together for social events, or go out in public
more often than people who do wear masks.

In short, there are numerous opportunities for COVID transmission even when
over three-quarters of people wear masks. Only a very high rate of mask usage
can dramatically reduce these opportunities.

## Public Activities, Social Distancing, and Masks

Earlier, I pointed out that mask use *reduces* the risk of COVID transmission
but does not eliminate it. This is why authorities such as the Centers for
Disease Control and most state health departments [recommend social distancing
together with mask
use](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html).
This means we can't simply compare states by their level of mask use to see if
masks are working; we must also compare their level of social distancing.

Our survey asks respondents a series of questions about activities, by asking,
"In the last 24 hours, have you done any of the following?" One possible choice
is "Spent time with someone who isn't currently staying with you"; whether this
is done with a mask or not, it represents a higher risk. And the data shows that
it's done more often in states where fewer people report wearing masks:

```{r social_distancing, message=FALSE}
spent_time <- covidcast_signal("fb-survey", "smoothed_wspent_time_1d",
                               start_day = "2020-12-01", end_day = "2020-12-01",
                               geo_type = "state")

mask_time <- masked %>%
  inner_join(spent_time, by = "geo_value", suffix = c(".mask", ".others"))

ggplot(mask_time,
       aes(x = value.mask, y = value.others, label = toupper(geo_value))) +
  geom_text() +
  labs(x = "% who report wearing masks most/all the time",
       y = "% who spent time with others in past 24 hours",
       title = "Social distancing reported in symptom survey",
       subtitle = "December 1st, 2020",
       caption = "Data from Delphi COVIDcast, delphi.cmu.edu") +
  theme_bw()
```

Similarly, SafeGraph collects anonymous data on visits to restaurants by using
cell phone location data. Using [county-level aggregates from our
API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/safegraph.html#safegraph-weekly-patterns),
we can compare mask use to the proportion of people visiting restaurants in each state:

```{r restaurants, message=FALSE}
# 2020-11-29 was most recent data available at time of writing
restaurants <- covidcast_signal("safegraph", "restaurants_visit_prop",
                                "2020-11-29", "2020-11-29",
                                geo_type = "state")

mask_rest <- masked %>%
  inner_join(restaurants, by = "geo_value",
             suffix = c(".mask", ".restaurant"))

ggplot(mask_rest,
       aes(x = value.mask, y = value.restaurant, label = toupper(geo_value))) +
  geom_text() +
  labs(x = "% who report wearing masks most/all the time",
       y = "Visits by SafeGraph panel, per 100,000 population",
       title = "Restaurant visits and mask use",
       subtitle = "December 1st, 2020",
       caption = "Data from Delphi COVIDcast, delphi.cmu.edu") +
  theme_bw()
```

These plots suggest that lower mask use is correlated with other risky
behaviors, which combine to produce more opportunities to spread the virus.
While these graphs only show two possible activities, our survey asks about
others---including working outside the home and attending large events---and our
API allows researchers to quickly combine this data with [SafeGraph's other
mobility data](`r blogdown::shortcode_html("apiref", "api/covidcast-signals/safegraph.html")`)
and other data sources that give a clearer picture of how people react to the
pandemic. By studying this aggregate data and the individual survey
responses, it will be possible to examine how mask use is associated with other
social distancing behavior.

## More Opportunities in Survey Data

Above, we've seen how our survey data can shed light on mask use in the United
States. Mask use is not as universal as it might seem, and there's substantial
variation between states on mask use and other social distancing behaviors.
Insights like these are important: Using this information about mask use
and activity, authorities can target their emergency orders and provide more
specific advice to the public.

While a short blog post can't hope to offer a thorough analysis proving which
behaviors reduce spread the most, we've make all our data publicly available
that the public health researchers building detailed models of COVID's spread
can combine it with other data to study how the pandemic spreads and what
interventions are most effective to stop it.

If you're one of those researchers, or you think this data could be useful for
your reporting or decision-making, see our [COVIDcast Epidata
API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html) for details
on how to get it. Numerous aggregates from the survey data, including more
measures of public activity, are [available through the
API](`r blogdown::shortcode_html("apiref", "api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.html")`),
and can be easily downloaded using [our R and Python
packages](`r blogdown::shortcode_html("apiref", "api/covidcast_clients.html")`).

We also make the raw response data available to academic and nonprofit
researchers, and we look forward to seeing more detailed analyses of this data.
For example, it would be important to know if people who do not wear masks are
more likely to do activities near other people, such as attending public events
or spending time with friends who do not live with them, than those who wear
masks regularly. Our survey asks respondents about these types of activities,
allowing us to understand how behavior varies. If you're an academic or
nonprofit researcher and want to do this kind of research, check out our [survey
documentation to get
started](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/symptom-survey/).
