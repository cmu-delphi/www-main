<p>Since December 2020, the <a href="https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/surveys/">COVID-19 Symptom
Survey</a> conducted by the Delphi Group
at Carnegie Mellon University and Facebook has included questions about COVID-19
vaccination behaviors and attitudes. Using de-identified aggregate data
including 2.8 million responses collected between January 10 and March 31, 2021,
<a href="https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/symptom-survey/contingency-tables.html">now available
publicly</a>,
we examined vaccine hesitancy and obstacles to vaccination for Hispanic adults
across the United States, and how their experiences differ from non-Hispanic
adults.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Vaccine hesitancy among Hispanic adults has significantly decreased
nationally; however, it remains high in midwestern and southeastern states.</strong>
Nationally, vaccine hesitancy among Hispanic adults has decreased
significantly (by 9.2 percentage points) between January and March 2021. This
is greater than the decline observed among non-Hispanic White adults (4.9
percentage points). However, there is still a large state-to-state difference
in vaccine hesitancy among Hispanic adults, and vaccine hesitancy remains the
highest in several states (e.g. Alabama, Montana, Tennessee, Wyoming, and
Ohio).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hispanic adults are much more likely to be vaccine-hesitant than
non-Hispanic White adults, and this mirrors gaps observed in vaccine uptake
between Hispanic and White adults.</strong> This disparity in vaccine hesitancy by
Hispanic ethnicity is especially high in Massachusetts, Washington, D.C.,
Connecticut, New Jersey, Colorado, and Montana. In several states, the large
disparities in vaccine hesitancy mirror large disparities in vaccine uptake.
For example, in Massachusetts and Connecticut, Hispanic adults are 70% more
likely to be vaccine-hesitant and 50% less likely to be vaccinated compared
to White adults. This suggests that addressing the gaps in vaccine hesitancy
among unvaccinated adults may also help close the gap in vaccine uptake
between Hispanic and White adults. Fortunately, the disparity in vaccine
hesitancy in many of these states is either decreasing or stable over time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There are several reasons for hesitancy that are given more frequently by
Hispanic adults than White adults, including safety and cost.</strong> Among
Hispanic adults, safety concerns and lack of confidence in vaccines remain
the top reasons for hesitancy in most states. In states where Hispanic adults
are much more likely to be vaccine-hesitant than White adults, Hispanic
adults are more likely than White adults to indicate that they are hesitant
due to many reasons, including safety concerns, lack of confidence in
vaccines, cost, and religious beliefs or altruism. For example, in Michigan,
8.3% of Hispanic adults select cost as a reason for hesitancy vs. 3.1% of
White adults, though federal law mandates that the vaccines be freely
available to everyone, regardless of insurance status.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hispanic adults feel less informed than White adults about how to get a
vaccine.</strong> This finding is consistent across all states. Georgia and Kansas
stand out as states that have one of the lowest proportion of Hispanic adults
who feel informed (45%) and as states where Hispanic adults are much less
likely than White adults to feel informed (30% less likely). States like
Georgia and Kansas with large disparities by Hispanic ethnicity are also
where Hispanic adults are much less likely than White adults to try to make a
vaccination appointment (more on this below), highlighting the need to
address potential information gaps and needs among Hispanic adults.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hispanic adults are much less likely to have a vaccination appointment or
have tried to make an appointment compared to White adults.</strong> Georgia and
North Carolina stand out in particular because these states also have the
lowest proportion of Hispanic adults who tried to make an appointment
(24.8-26.9% compared to the national average of 31.8%), and Hispanic adults
were much less likely to try than White adults (relative ratio of 0.7). This
suggests that addressing vaccine hesitancy alone will not be sufficient to
eliminate disparities in uptake between Hispanic and White adults, and that
other approaches such as increasing availability of information about how to
get a vaccine may be necessary, as noted above. It is also possible that, in
addition to the information gap, immigration status may also be a barrier,
given that these states have some of the largest unauthorized immigrant
populations in the US.</p></li>

<h2>Current state of vaccine hesitancy among the Hispanic population</h2>
<p>During the week of March 21-27, 16.3% of Hispanic adults reported being
vaccine-hesitant. This hesitancy rate is down 9.3 percentage points from early
January, when it was 25.6%.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-04-29-vaccine-trends-hispanic_files/hesitancy_over_time_hispanic_and_white_adults.png" /></p>
<p>We can also see that since January, the initial 3.8 percentage point gap in
vaccine hesitancy between Hispanic adults and non-Hispanic White adults has
closed. Hesitancy rates among Hispanic adults are now similar to those among
non-Hispanic White adults (16.9%).</p>
<p>However, vaccine hesitancy among Hispanic adults continues to remain high in
several states. AL (30.8%), TN (29.1%), OH (26.3%), MT (29.1%), and WY (27.3%)
have the highest proportion of vaccine-hesitant Hispanic adults, while DC
(7.2%), CA (13.7%), MD (14%), IL (14.6%), and CT (15.8%) have the lowest
proportion of vaccine hesitancy among Hispanic adults:</p>

</div>
<div id="disparities-in-vaccine-hesitancy-between-hispanic-and-non-hispanic-white-adults" class="section level2">
<h2>Disparities in vaccine hesitancy between Hispanic and non-Hispanic White adults</h2>
<p>Despite similar rates nationally, several states have a large disparity in
vaccine hesitancy between Hispanic and non-Hispanic White adults:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-04-29-vaccine-trends-hispanic_files/table1.png" /></p>
<p>The top ten states with the largest disparity by Hispanic ethnicity are DC
(4.3×), MA (1.9×), CT (1.7×), HI (1.7×), RI (1.6×), PA (1.4×), MI (1.3×), CO
(1.3×), NJ (1.3×), and MT (1.3×) [Table 1].</p>
<p>Montana stands out in particular as a state with room for improvement because it
also has the one of the highest vaccine hesitancy rates among the Hispanic
population.</p>
<p>The large disparity in vaccine hesitancy observed in MA, CT, RI, PA, MI, and CO
mirrors disparities in vaccine uptake. These states have one of the largest
disparities in vaccination rates in the country (White-to-Hispanic vaccination
rate ratios &gt; 2.0 <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/latest-data-on-covid-19-vaccinations-race-ethnicity/">according to
KFF</a>),
which suggests that addressing the disparity in hesitancy among unvaccinated
adults may also help address the disparity in vaccine uptake between Hispanic
and White adults.</p>
<p>The top ten states where Hispanic adults are less likely to be
vaccine-hesitant compared to White adults are TX (0.76×), NV (0.84×), GA
(0.86×), AR (0.91×), UT (0.91×), MO (0.92×), ID (0.92×), LA (0.93×), IL
(0.93×), and IA (0.94×).</p>
<p>Arkansas and Iowa stand out in particular because these may be states where even
though Hispanic adults are less hesitant, they may be having trouble making
vaccination appointments. According to KFF, Arkansas and Iowa have one of the
largest disparities in vaccination uptake between White and Hispanic adults
(i.e., White adults are &gt;2.5× more likely to get vaccinated than Hispanic
adults), despite our data demonstrating that Hispanic adults are less
vaccine-hesitant than White adults in these states. This suggests that there
may be more barriers related to accessibility for Hispanic adults. As our
data demonstrate in later sections of the report, Arkansas indeed has one of the
states where Hispanic adults are much less likely to try to make an
appointment.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the disparity in vaccine hesitancy in many of these states
(including MA, CO, PA, CT, NJ, and MI) is either decreasing or stable over
time:</p>

<h2>What causes the disparities?</h2>
<div id="reasons-for-vaccine-hesitancy" class="section level3">
<h3>Reasons for vaccine hesitancy</h3>
<p>In states with the largest disparities in vaccine hesitancy between Hispanic and
White adults (CO, CT, DC, HI, MA, MI, MT, NJ, PA, and RI), reasons for hesitancy
among Hispanic adults are shown here:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-04-29-vaccine-trends-hispanic_files/reasons_among_hispanic_top10_states.png" /></p>
<p>There seem to be several key groups of common reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Safety
<ul>
<li>Concerns about side effects (45-52%)</li>
<li>Wanting to wait and see if it’s safe (38-50%)</li>
<li>Concerns about allergic reactions (24-29%)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lack of confidence
<ul>
<li>Do not trust COVID-19 vaccines (33-44%)</li>
<li>Do not trust government (22-39%)</li>
<li>Do not think the vaccine will work (22-26%)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Belief that they don’t need the vaccine (18-33%)</li>
<li>Altruism (believing other people need it more) (19-29%)</li>
</ol>
<p>We can also compare these reasons to White adults:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-04-29-vaccine-trends-hispanic_files/reasons_among_hispanic_and_white_adults_top10_states.png" /></p>
<p>When compared to White adults, Hispanic adults are much more likely to indicate
that the reasons for hesitancy are related to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Safety or health
<ul>
<li>Concerns about allergy: CO (+5.2 percentage points [pp]), MA (+6.7pp), MI
(+5.4pp), PA (+4.7pp), CT (+1.9pp), NJ (+1.3pp)</li>
<li>Wanting to wait and see if it’s safe: CT (+6.3pp), PA (+4.4pp), MI
(+1.8pp), MA (+0.5pp)</li>
<li>Concerns related to pregnancy: CT (+4.4pp), CO (+3.5pp), MA (+3.1pp), PA
(+1.3pp)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cost
<ul>
<li>CO (+4.7pp), MI (+5.2pp), MA (+1.7pp), PA (+1.4pp), CT (+1.4pp), NJ
(+0.7pp)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lack of confidence
<ul>
<li>Do not think the vaccine will work: MA (+6.3pp), CT (+2.8pp), CO (+2.6pp),
NJ (+2.5pp), MI (+0.5pp), PA (+0.1pp)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Religious beliefs or altruism
<ul>
<li>It is against their religious beliefs: CO (+4.2pp), CT (+3pp), MI (+3pp),
PA (+1.8pp)</li>
<li>They believe other people need it more: CO (+5.5pp), NJ (+2.8pp)</li>
</ul></li>

<div id="feeling-informed-about-how-to-get-a-vaccination" class="section level3">
<h3>Feeling informed about how to get a vaccination</h3>
<p>Feeling informed about how to get a vaccination among Hispanic adults varies
significantly across states:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-04-29-vaccine-trends-hispanic_files/map_informed_among_hispanic.png" /></p>
<p>The top 5 states where Hispanic adults feel the most informed are HI (66% feel
very or moderately informed), IN (60.7%), RI (60.1%), NM (59.4%), and DE
(59.3%). The states where Hispanic adults feel the least informed are GA
(45.2%), KS (45.3%), TN (45.9%), NE (46.4%), MD (47%):</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-04-29-vaccine-trends-hispanic_files/table2.png" /></p>
<p>Across all states, however, Hispanic adults report feeling less informed about
getting a vaccination than White adults. Nationally, 53.5% of Hispanic adults
report being very or moderately informed about how they will be able to get a
COVID-19 vaccination, compared to 66% of non-Hispanic white adults.</p>
<p>The largest disparities by Hispanic ethnicity are also observed mostly in
states where Hispanic adults feel the least informed: GA (0.7×), MD (0.72×),
TN (0.72×), and KS (0.73×).</p>
<p>The states with the largest disparities by Hispanic ethnicity are also where
Hispanic adults were much less likely than White adults to try to make a
vaccination appointment, suggesting that an information gap may contribute to
disparities in making appointments to receive a vaccination.</p>
<p>In GA, KS, and CT, Hispanic adults feel less informed than White adults
(0.7× in GA, 0.73× in KS, 0.74× in CT), and they are also much less likely
to have tried to make a vaccination appointment (0.49× in GA, 0.58× in KS,
0.53× in CT).</p>
</div>
<div id="having-a-vaccination-appointment-and-trying-to-make-an-appointment" class="section level3">
<h3>Having a vaccination appointment and trying to make an appointment</h3>
<p>Nationally, the proportion of unvaccinated vaccine-accepting Hispanic adults
who currently have an appointment to get a vaccination (9.4%) is much lower
than for White adults (15.7%). There is, however, significant disparity by
state:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-04-29-vaccine-trends-hispanic_files/map_appt_have_among_hispanic.png" /></p>
<p>The top 5 states with the lowest proportion of Hispanic adults who have an
appointment are WA (6%), OR (6.6%), MD (6.7%), GA (6.9%), and FL (7%):</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-04-29-vaccine-trends-hispanic_files/table3.png" /></p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-04-29-vaccine-trends-hispanic_files/table4.png" /></p>
<p>GA stands out because it also has the lowest proportion of Hispanic adults
who tried to make an appointment (24.8% compared to the national average of
31.8%), and Hispanic adults were much less likely to try than White adults
(0.71×). This suggests that addressing vaccine hesitancy alone will not be
sufficient to eliminate disparities in uptake between Hispanic and White
adults, and that other approaches such as increasing availability of
information about how to get a vaccine may be necessary.</p>
<p>Similar to GA, NC had one of the lowest proportion of Hispanic adults who
tried to make an appointment (26.9%) and Hispanic adults were much less
likely to try than White adults (0.7×). This suggests that in addition to
the information gap as noted above, immigration status may also be a
barrier, as these states have some of the largest unauthorized immigrant
populations in the US according to the DHS.</p>
<p>The top 5 states with the highest proportion of Hispanic adults who have an
appointment to get a vaccination are IN (21.5%), NM (15.6%), RI (14.1%), HI
(13.8%), and OK (13.1%).</p>
<p>RI stands out as a state where Hispanic adults are also more likely to have
appointments than White adults (1.29×).</p>
<p>NM stands out as a state that has the highest proportion of Hispanic adults
who also tried to make an appointment (52.4% compared to the national
average of 31.8%).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This analysis illustrates the type of detailed geographic and demographic
breakdowns that the COVID Symptom Survey makes possible, as well as the current
challenges facing the COVID-19 vaccination effort in the United States.</p>
<p>It’s important to keep the survey’s limitations in mind. The Symptom Survey
weighted population estimates for characteristics such as age, gender, and
certain chronic conditions are generally comparable to estimates from other data
sources at both the national and state level. However, our survey population may
still over- or under-represent certain subpopulations or characteristics related
to education, race, and occupation because we do not account for these
characteristics in the weighting of our survey responses. In particular, the
weighted sample is slightly under-representative of low-education adults as well
as Black or African American and Hispanic adults.</p>
