Most pandemic research has focused on questions related to prediction such as:
how many COVID cases do we expect to see next week in Allegheny County? Causal
inference, on the other hand, is concerned with "what if" questions. For
example: what would happen if everyone wore masks? How many cases would there be
if there was a lockdown? How many deaths would occur if 40 percent of the
population is vaccinated? These questions involve hypothetical interventions on
a population.

Estimating causal effects is tricky. We all know that "correlation
isn't causation." For example, mask usage and cases could both
increase over time. But that doesn't mean that masks cause more cases
to occur.  Activation of "Buckle your seatbelt" signs on airplanes is
correlated with turbulence. But activating the sign does not cause
turbulence.

So how do we estimate causal effects? There is a collection of methods
for this task. The important thing is that we can't just use standard
prediction methods. We need to use specialized methods that were designed
for causal inference. In this post we will discuss our work on
the causal effect of social mobility on deaths from COVID. The social mobility
variable we will use is the proportion of people staying home. We can think of
this of anti-mobility, and expect that higher values of this variable will lead
to fewer deaths from COVID.

Let’s start with a brief introduction to causal inference.


## Causal Inference

Causal inference
is a huge, complex topic.
We give a very brief
exposition of some key ideas here.
To learn more,
we recommend [the book
by Hernan and Robins](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/) and
the paper
"[Statistics and Causal Inference](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2289064)"
by Paul Holland
(*Journal of the American Statistical Association* 1986, pp. 945-960).
And one can find many tutorials
on the web.

Suppose we have
three variables
$X$, $A$ and $Y$, where
$Y$ is the  outcome of interest
(such as deaths from COVID),
$A$ is a treatment or exposure
(such as mobility level),
and $X$ are confounding variables,
which are variables that affect both
$A$ and $Y$ (such as age).
The joint density is

$$
p(x,a,y) = p(x)p(a|x)p(y|x,a).
$$

We want to know: what would be the mean of $Y$
if we could set $A$ to be equal to some value $a$?
For example,
what would the number of COVID cases be
if 92 percent of people wore masks?
We let $Y^a$
denote this hypothetical outcome,
which is called a counterfactual or potential outcome.
And we denote the mean of $Y^a$ by
$\mathbb{E}[Y^a]$.

If we have measured all the confounding variables
then the answer
(ignoring a few technical details)
is given by
Robins' $g$-formula:

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y^a] = \int \mu(x,a) p(x) dx = \mathbb{E}[\mu(X,a)]
$$

where
$\mu(x,a) = \mathbb{E}[Y|X=x,A=a]$
is the mean of $Y$ given $X$ and $A$.
This is not equal to
the mean of $Y$ given $A=a$, which is
$\mathbb{E}[Y|A=a] = \int \mu(x,a) p(x|a) dx$.
This is the difference between causation
and prediction (correlation).
You can think of
the $g$-formula as the mean of $Y$
if we replace $p(a|x)$
in the joint density
with a point mass at $a$.
Using the $g$-formula is one example of *adjusting for
confounding*.

Now suppose we observe data
$(X_1,A_1,Y_1),\dots,(X_n,A_n,Y_n)$.
How do we estimate
$\mathbb{E}[Y^a]$?
The simplest approach is to
get an estimate  $\hat\mu(x,a)$ of $\mu(x,a)$
(this is just regression) and replace the integral
in the $g$-formula
with a sample average to get the estimate

$$
\hat{\mathbb{E}(Y^a)} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i \hat\mu(X_i,a).
$$

This is called the plug-in estimator. (Note that for prediction we would not use
this formula. We would just use $\hat \mu(X, A)$.)
There are often better estimators,
but we won't get into that here.
The important thing
is:
there is a formula for the causal effect
and we can estimate it.

The first plot below shows an example where we would predict
higher values of $Y$ when $A$ is large.  For pure prediction, this is
the correct conclusion.  The second plot shows that once we
account for $X = \text{age}$ (corresponding to different colors) there is
a negative relationship between $Y$ and $A$: for a given person with a fixed
age, increasing $A$ would *decrease* $Y$. In this case, age is a
confounder and the $g$-formula would correctly recover the negative
relationship. For causal inference, this is the correct conclusion.

Things get trickier
when there are time varying variables.
Consider weekly mobility and death data
$(A_1,Y_1),\dots, (A_T,Y_T)$
in one state.
For simplicity, we'll assume that there are no $X$ variables. But we'll see that at time $t$, the
variables $Y_1, \dots, Y_{t-1}$ are confounding variables for the causal effect of
mobility on $Y_t$.
Define
$\overline{A}_t = (A_1,\dots, A_t)$ and
$\overline{Y}_t = (Y_1,\dots, Y_t)$
for $t\geq 1$.
The density
of $(\overline{y}_t,\overline{a}_t)$
can be written as

$$
p(\overline{y}_t,\overline{a}_t) =
\prod_{s=1}^t p(y_s|\overline{y}_{s-1},\overline{a}_{s}) p(a_s|\overline{a}_{s-1},\overline{y}_{s-1}).
$$

Now consider
the causal question:

What would $Y_t$ be if we set
$\overline{A}_t$ equal to some value
$\overline{a}_t  =(a_1,\dots, a_t)$?

Let
$Y^{\overline{a}_t}_t$
denote this counterfactual quantity.
For example, if $A_t$ is mobility,
measuring, say, the percentage of people who stay home,
and
$\overline{a}_t = (12,12,12,6,6,6)$
then
$Y^{\overline{a}_t}_t$
is the number of deaths
we would observe if we set mobility to 12 for three weeks
then set it to 6 for three weeks.

How do we
find the mean $\mathbb{E}[Y^{\overline{a}_t}_t]$?
As a general rule,
we adjust for pre-treatment variables but
not for post-treatment variables.
But in the time varying case,
this rule makes no sense.
Each $Y_t$ is both a pre-treatment variable
(it occurs before $A_{t+1}$) and
a post-treatment variable
(it occurs after $A_{t-1}$).
The correct way to
get the mean of $\mathbb{E}[Y^{\overline{a}_t}]$
is to use the more general form
of the $g$-formula:

$$
\psi(\overline{a}_t)\equiv
\mathbb{E}[Y^{\overline{a}_t}_t] =
\int\cdots\int
\mathbb{E} \left[Y_t | \overline{A}_t = \overline{a}_t, \overline{Y}_{t-1}=\overline{y}_{t-1}\right]
\prod_{s=1}^{t-1} p(y_s|\overline{y}_{s-1},\overline{a}_{s})
d y_s.
$$

You can ignore that equation
if you like;
suffice it to say that
there is indeed a formula
for the quantity we are interested in.

We note, by the way, that some authors denote
$\mathbb{E}[Y^{\overline{a}_t}_t]$ by
$\mathbb{E}[Y_t| {\rm do}(\overline{a}_t)]$.
They mean the same thing.

Having a formula for
$\psi(\overline{a}_t)$
is great, but how do we estimate it?
Again we could plug-in estimates
of all the quantities in
the $g$-formula.
But there are
better things we can do,
as we now explain.

## A Marginal Structural Model

The approach we use is
to make use of
something called
a *marginal structural model* (MSM).

Usually when we construct
a statistical model,
we are trying to
come up with
a way to express the distribution
of the data, in this case,
$(A_1,Y_1),\dots, (A_T,Y_T)$.
In effect, we want a formula
that explains how we would generate
a dataset
like the one we have.
But to do so in a tractable way
usually involves making a bunch of
assumptions about the model.
Instead, with an MSM,
we specify a plausible
model for
the form of the function
$\mathbb{E}[Y^{\overline{a}_t}]$
but we otherwise leave the model
for the data unspecified.
For example, we might assume
that $\mathbb{E}[Y^{\overline{a}_t}]\approx \beta_0 + \beta \sum_s a_s$.
In a sense, we are spending our modeling assumptions wisely:
we want the effect of the treatment to be smooth
and fairly simple.
But we otherwise don't want to impose assumptions.

The model we use is

$$
\mathbb{E}[L_t^{\overline{a}_t}]= s(t) + \beta M_t
$$

where
$L_t = \log (1+Y_t)$ is log-deaths,
$s(t)$ is an arbitrary, smooth, increasing function
and

$$
M_t = \sum_{s=1}^{t-\delta}(a_s-a_1)
$$

is cumulative mobility (compared to baseline mobility).
Based on published studies, we take $\delta = 4$ weeks.
(We switch from deaths to log-deaths mainly for
certain numerical reasons related to the software we are using.)
Here, $s(t)$ represents the
evolution of the pandemic if there were no
interventions and no reduction in
susceptible individuals.
The term $\beta M_t$ captures
the effect of mobility.
With no change in mobility,
deaths increase exponentially as $e^{s(t)}$.

The intuition for using cumulative mobility
comes from ideas from epidemic modeling.
Roughly,
if $I_t$ denotes new infections in week $t$,
we might assume that
$I_t \approx e^{\nu(t) + \beta A_t} I_{t-1}$
for some function $\nu(t)$.
This implies that
$I_{t-1} \approx e^{\nu(t-1) + \beta A_{t-1}} I_{t-2}$
and so on.
If we continue back to $t=1$ we find that
$I_t \approx e^{s(t) + \beta \sum_s A_s} I_1$
where $s(t)=\sum_{s=1}^t \nu(s)$.
If we further assume that
some fraction of people infected a time $t$
will die in $\delta$ weeks,
then we can derive the above model.
(More complex models are discussed in the paper.)

To re-cap:
we are leaving the
distribution $P$ of the data
$(A_1,Y_1),\dots, (A_T,Y_T)$
unspecified,
except that we require:
if you apply
the $g$-formula
to $P$ you must get
$s(t) + \beta M_t$.
In other words,
the statistical model is the
set of all densities
$p(\overline{\ell}_t,\overline{a}_t)$ that satisfy the condition

$$
\int\cdots\int
\mathbb{E}[L_t | \overline{A}_t = \overline{a}_t, \overline{L}_{t-1}=\overline{\ell}_{t-1}]
\prod_{s=1}^{t-1} p(\ell_s|\overline{\ell}_{s-1},\overline{a}_{s})
d \ell_s =
s(t) + \beta M_t.
$$

This is an example of a semiparametric model:
a model that has some sort of constraint
but is otherwise nonparametric.


Estimating the MSM is a bit involved.
A key step is estimating the following function

$$
W_t = \frac{p(a_t|\overline{a}_{t-1})}{p(a_t| \overline{y}_{t-1},\overline{a}_{t-1},\overline{x}_{t-1})}
$$

where $\overline{x}_{t-1}$
represents potential confounding variables.
The model is fit with these weights
and the weights are crucial
because that is how we adjust for confounding in the MSM.
We won't go into detail here.
Instead,
let's look at the data
and the estimates.

## The Data and the Results

The data we use
are weekly deaths
and weekly averaged mobility
starting February 15 2019.
The mobility signal
we'll consider here is the
proportion of people of who stay home,
which is kindly provided to Delphi by
SafeGraph.
(We `r blogdown::shortcode_html("apireflink", "api/covidcast-signals/safegraph.html", "publish this data")`
in our `r blogdown::shortcode_html("apireflink", "api/covidcast.html", "COVIDcast Epidata API")`,
so it is available to anyone interested in studying mobility during the pandemic.)
We use data at the state level.
Note that this is actually a sort of anti-mobility measure:
the higher it is, the less mobility there is.
Here are plots of
weekly deaths and mobility
starting February 15, 2020,
for a few states:

                 y = select(states_mobility, time_value, geo_value, value),
                 by = c("time_value" = "time_value", "geo_value" = "geo_value"))

dat <- dat %>%
  rename(date = time_value,
         state = geo_value,
         stay_home = value.y,
         deaths = value.x) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  # epi week is from saturday to sunday
  mutate(weekday = wday(date, label = TRUE, week_start = 6),
         weeknum = wday(date, week_start = 6),
         week = cumsum(weeknum == 1))

dat_week <- dat %>%

  mutate(weekly_deaths = sum(deaths),
         weekly_deaths = 1 + weekly_deaths, # avoid 0 in the log scale
         weekly_stay_home = mean(stay_home)) %>%
  select(week, state, weekly_stay_home, weekly_deaths, weekly_deaths) %>%
  unique()

  geom_line() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  geom_dl(aes(label = toupper(state)), method = "last.bumpup") +
  labs(x = "Week", y = "# deaths (log scale)",
       title = "Reported deaths over time",
       subtitle = "From JHU CSSE COVID-19 data",
       caption = "Data from Delphi COVIDcast, delphi.cmu.edu") +
  theme_bw() +
  guides(color = FALSE)
```

```{r mobility-by-state}
ggplot(dat_week, aes(x = week, y = weekly_stay_home, color = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_dl(aes(label = toupper(state)), method = "last.bumpup") +
  labs(x = "Week", y = "Proportion staying at home",

       subtitle = "From SafeGraph",
       caption = "Data from Delphi COVIDcast, delphi.cmu.edu") +
  theme_bw() +
  guides(color = FALSE)
```

After fitting the MSM,
we can estimate various quantities.
Let's consider the effect
of changing the observed
stay-at-home series
$(A_1,\dots, A_T)$
to the hypothetical value
$\overline{a}_T = (A_1+\gamma,\dots, A_T+\gamma)$.
In other words,
what would have happened
if we had increased stay-at-home by $\gamma$?
Below is the estimated
difference in deaths
(with 90 percent pointwise confidence bands)
for a few states:
Arizona, California, Florida and Georgia.
The plot shows the mean of

$$
Y_t^\gamma - Y_t
$$

where $Y_t$ is the number of deaths
and
$Y_t^\gamma$
is the (counterfactual) number of deaths
we would have observed of mobility had
been increases by $\gamma$ at all times,
where we take $\gamma = 10$
(a ten percent increase in stay-at-home).
The fact that the values
are negative
indicates that increasing
stay-at-home decreases deaths, as we would expect.
(We remind the reader
that these results are preliminary.)

## What's Next?

One important question in every
causal analysis is: what if there
is unobserved confounding?
In the current problem,
a confounder
is a variable that affects
both mobility and death from COVID.
We try to include as many plausible
observed confounding variables
as possible.
So far we use all
past values of death and mobility as
confounding variables.
But of course,
it is always possible
that there are unobserved confounders.
Currently,
we are conducting a sensitivity analysis
to assess how robust the estimates are
to unobserved confounders.

In this post we have only
addressed mobility.
As soon as the mobility analysis
is complete
we will turn our attention
to estimating
the causal effect of masks on COVID cases.
