  Since April 2020, in addition to our massive daily survey advertised on
  Facebook, we've been running (even-more-massive) surveys through Google to
  track the spread of COVID-19 in the United States.
  At its peak, our Google survey was taken by over 1.2 million people in a single
  day, and over its first month in operation, averaged over 600,000 daily
  respondents. In mid-May, we paused daily dissemination of this survey in order
  to focus on our (longer, more complex) survey through Facebook,
  but we plan to bring back the Google survey this fall.
  This short post covers some key differences between our Google and Facebook
  surveys, explains the backstory behind the "CLI-in-community" question
  as it arose through our collaboration with Google,
  and shares some of our thinking about next steps for the Google survey.

  estimates from the aggregated survey data. Sangwon Hyun, Natalia Lombardi de
  Oliveira, and Lester Mackey greatly extended and improved this codebase, and
  they developed, along with Ryan, the underlying statistical methodology. Ryan
  came up with the idea of running the surveys, and worked with Google to make
  this a reality. On the Google side, Brett Slatkin and Hal Varian have been key
  collaborators; Brett wrote the code to get daily survey data over to Delphi's
  estimation pipeline; and both contributed numerous important ideas at various
  stages of the project.

Since April 2020, in addition to our `r blogdown::shortcode_html("reflink", "2020-08-26-fb-survey", "massive daily survey advertised on Facebook")`,
we've been running (even-more-massive) surveys through Google to track the
spread of COVID-19 in the United States. At its peak, our Google survey was
taken by over 1.2 million people in a single day, and over its first month in
operation, averaged about 600,000 daily respondents. As usual, we make
aggregated data from this survey available through our `r blogdown::shortcode_html("apireflink", "api/covidcast.html", "COVIDcast API")`.

In mid-May, we decided to pause daily dissemination of this survey in order to
focus on our (longer, more complex) survey through Facebook,
but we plan to bring back the Google survey this fall.
The two surveys are, in fact, quite different and complement each other nicely.
This short post covers some key differences between our Google and Facebook
surveys, explains the backstory behind the "CLI-in-community" question
as it arose through our collaboration with Google's team,
and shares some of our thinking about next steps for the Google survey.

## Short Background

Back in March 2020, around the time we began discussions with Facebook about
COVID-19 symptom surveys, we pitched the same idea to Google.
Our motivation, `r blogdown::shortcode_html("reflink", "2020-08-26-fb-survey#why-run-these-surveys", "as we explained in our last post")`,
has been to produce real-time, county-level data streams of self-reported COVID
symptoms that can potentially serve as **early indicators** of COVID activity in
the US. As we noted in that post, we weren't the only data scientists
who thought of running COVID-19 symptom surveys, and several
other groups had deployed surveys before us.
What distinguished our strategy from others'
was the pursuit of a giant like Google to achieve widespread and continuous
dissemination (well beyond what we could do ourselves).
Google's willingness to help was a _huge_ win for us.
Of all the partnerships we formed to create new COVID-19 indicators,
our deal with Google was the first to come through.
This gave us an invaluable confidence boost,
and taught us the silver lining of this pandemic:
that many people are truly generous and willing to help.
Google's contributions didn't stop there---they have been helping us in
[various ways ever since](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-org/google-supports-covid-19-ai-and-data-analytics-projects).

Our initial survey with Google launched in late March,
deployed through various websites and apps (with whom Google partners
to run questionnaires). Each respondent opted-in to answering the survey and
agreed to legal disclosures about how the data would be used. The survey asked
just a single question:

> Do you or anyone in your household have a fever of at least 100 °F, along
> with cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing?

This pattern of symptoms defines a condition called
**COVID-like illness** or **CLI**.
A respondent could reply "Yes", "No", or "Prefer not to say".
We're also given the respondent's (inferred) county from IP address lookup.
At the start, this survey data allowed us to estimate the daily % CLI,
the percentage of people with COVID-like illness, in over 1,000 counties across
the US. After about 2 weeks, we stopped the survey.
Google wondered whether we could get equally useful information without asking
a question of such a sensitive nature. In general, asking a person about their
health (or their family’s health) is not common practice on Google’s survey
platform. The hope was that asking a broader question might also improve
response rates, reduce costs, and increase the number of potential respondents.

## CLI-in-Community

Working with Brett Slatkin (head of Google Surveys)
and Hal Varian (Google's Chief Economist), we looked for a new question.
Brett came up with a list of questions that were acceptable,
and the most promising among them was:

> Do you know of someone in your community who is sick with a fever, along with
> cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing right now?

We decided to deploy this proxy question[^1] on April 11, 2020.
We narrowed our focus to fewer counties:
roughly the top 600 in terms of population,
and estimated the daily % CLI-in-community,
the percentage of people who _know someone in their community_ with COVID-like
illness. The initial results far exceeded our expectations,
and were promising enough that within days we added
this CLI-in-community question to our survey through Facebook.

[^1]:
    In the survey methodology literature, a "proxy question" is one in which
    the subject is asked to report on someone else. The traditional view seems to
    be that proxy questions can undermine survey data quality, but in our setting
    it's critical: not only does it provide a safeguard against revealing personal
    health information, it turned out to deliver `r blogdown::shortcode_html("reflink", "2020-08-26-fb-survey#basic-correlation-analysis", "much higher correlations")`
    with case rates than the direct (non-proxy) question.

To give you a feel for the data, below we plot
the daily new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people
versus the estimated % CLI-in-community from our Google survey,
at the state level, averaged over April 11 to mid-May.
This is shown on the left, and on the right,
we reproduce this with the estimated % CLI-in-community from our Facebook
survey.

             alpha = 0.5) +

  geom_text(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "% CLI-in-community from Google surveys",
       y = "Daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people",
       title = "COVID-19 case rates vs Google % CLI-in-community",

  theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom")
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

In both plots, we see a reassuring trend,
but the trend on the left is noticeably stronger.
Indeed, the correlation here between the Google signal and case rates is
`r round(cor(df1$x, df1$y), 2)`,
while that between the Facebook signal and case rates is
`r round(cor(df2$x, df2$y), 2)`.
To be fair, we should note that the Google signal comprises a much
larger number of survey samples (as we'll emphasize next),
and the Facebook signal's correlations to case rates shot up in mid-June
(as we saw last time and we'll revisit, shortly).

From April 11 through May 14, we ran Google surveys in over 600 counties
per day, with a target of at least 1,000 responses per county.
The average number of responses per day was over 600,000,
and at its peak, over 1.2 million!
(By comparison, our survey through Facebook averages
about 74,000 responses per day.)
The actual sampling scheme behind our Google survey is more complicated,
and involves two-level stratification, across both counties and states.
For details, including those on statistical estimation,
visit our `r blogdown::shortcode_html("apireflink", "api/covidcast-signals/google-survey.html", "COVIDcast signals documentation")`.
On May 15, we paused our Google survey to focus on our Facebook survey,
which is both longer and more complex.
Importantly, the latter is _not_ a replacement for the former,
and our two surveys have different and complementary use cases.

## Our Two Surveys

We discuss some similarities and differences
between the Google and Facebook surveys.
Starting with similarities, both have been deployed at a massive scale,
reaching tens of thousands of people per day,
and covering much of the US at the county level.
To state the obvious, both ask the same question:
whether a person knows someone in their community with COVID-like illness,
and both lead to an estimate of % CLI-in-community.

Below we assess the numerical similarity of these estimates via correlations:
we correlate them against each other, and for reference,
correlate each against COVID-19 case rates.
To be more specific, for each pair of the following:
Google signal, Facebook signal, and COVID-19 case rates,
and for each day that we have data available,
we compute the Spearman correlation across all counties
that had at least 200 cumulative COVID-19 cases
by May 14 (the end of Google survey data).
Over the first month of data, from mid-April to mid-May,
we can see that the highest correlations clearly belong to
those between the two survey signals.
This is as expected, since in principle,
these two surveys are measuring the same underlying quantity.[^2]
The next largest correlations over the first month
belong to those between the Google signal and case rates,
which for the most part holds a substantial gap over the
correlations between the Facebook signal and case rates.
This is no doubt encouraging, especially because we'd hope
that the Google correlations would have only improved later in
the year (as did the Facebook correlations, which we `r blogdown::shortcode_html("reflink", "2020-08-26-fb-survey#basic-correlation-analysis", "previously suggested")`
could have been due to the increase in the diversity of county-level
case rates around mid-June).

[^2]:
    A closer look reveals that the relationship between the Google
    % CLI-in-community and Facebook % CLI-in-community signals is not 1:1. For
    example, you can check the x-axes in the first example in this blog post: the
    range of the Facebook signal is over twice that of the Google signal. There
    are differences in the setups we can point to: the two surveys phrase the
    CLI-in-community question slightly differently; they reach different subpopulations
    of the US; and the estimation procedures behind the surveys handle
    missing responses differently. But as far as we can tell, none of this can really
    explain why the Facebook numbers are over twice as large as the Google ones, a
    trend that seems pretty consistent across location and time. We'll save rigorous
    analysis for when we work on deploying these two surveys in tandem; for now, we
    emphasize that this observation reiterates the importance of focusing on
    _time-varying trends_ in the survey signals, not the signal values themselves
    (a point we `r blogdown::shortcode_html("reflink", "2020-08-26-fb-survey#why-run-these-surveys", "made in our last post")`).
    Here, the self-reporting aspect must somehow be creating greatly different
    levels of bias in the two surveys; in an absolute sense, the subsequent
    estimates of % CLI-in-community strongly disagree, so both can't be right, and
    this casts doubt on the idea that either could be bias-free.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5}
# Fetch county-level Google and Facebook % CLI-in-community signals, and JHU
# confirmed case incidence proportion
df_go = covidcast_signal("google-survey", "smoothed_cli")

start_day = min(df_go$time_value)
end_day = "2020-09-01"

df_fb = covidcast_signal("fb-survey", "smoothed_hh_cmnty_cli",
                         start_day, end_day)
df_in = covidcast_signal("jhu-csse", "confirmed_7dav_incidence_prop",
                         start_day, end_day)

# Consider only counties with at least 200 cumulative cases by Google's end
case_num = 200
geo_values = covidcast_signal("jhu-csse", "confirmed_cumulative_num",
                              max(df_go$time_value), max(df_go$time_value)) %>%
  filter(value >= case_num) %>% pull(geo_value)
df_go_act = df_go %>% filter(geo_value %in% geo_values)
df_fb_act = df_fb %>% filter(geo_value %in% geo_values)
df_in_act = df_in %>% filter(geo_value %in% geo_values)

# Compute correlations, per time, over all counties
df_cor1 = covidcast_cor(df_go_act, df_in_act, by = "time_value",
                        method = "spearman")
df_cor2 = covidcast_cor(df_fb_act, df_in_act, by = "time_value",
                        method = "spearman")
df_cor3 = covidcast_cor(df_go_act, df_fb_act, by = "time_value",
                        method = "spearman")

# Stack rowwise into one data frame, then plot time series
df_cor = rbind(df_cor1, df_cor2, df_cor3)
df_cor$what = c(rep("Google and case rates", nrow(df_cor1)),
                rep("Facebook and case rates", nrow(df_cor2)),
                rep("Google and Facebook", nrow(df_cor3)))
ggplot(df_cor, aes(x = time_value, y = value)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = what)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = ggplot_colors) +
  labs(title = "Correlation between survey signals and case rates",
       subtitle = sprintf("Over all counties with at least %i cumulative cases",
                          case_num),
       x = "Date", y = "Correlation") +
    theme_bw() + theme(legend.pos = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())
```

Now let's consider the differences between the surveys. Here's a summary:

- Our Facebook survey is _advertised by Facebook_ but _run by us_ (on a
  CMU-licensed Qualtrics platform); this means that we receive all the
  individual survey responses directly (and Facebook never sees any of the data).

- On the other hand, our Google survey is _deployed directly by Google_ through
  partner websites and apps they use to run questionnaires;
  this means that we don't see individual survey responses,
  but receive aggregated survey data from Google.

- This makes a big difference as to how much (and what questions) we can ask on
  the survey: our Google survey is just a single question long, and our Facebook
  survey is much longer and more detailed, currently over 35 questions.

- Finally, there's a big difference in how much we control with respect to the
  geographic distribution of the survey samples: on our Facebook survey, we have
  no control over this, but on our Google survey we have full control,
  in that we can pick the counties we want to sample from ahead of time.

## Google Survey Redux

As we can see from the above summary,
the two survey schemes are complementary,
and could be used synergistically.
Our Facebook survey is a continuously-running, wide-reaching instrument
that provides answers to a `r blogdown::shortcode_html("apireflink", "symptom-survey/coding.html", "rich set of questions")`
(beyond COVID-related symptoms, it asks about
contacts, risk factors, behavior, and demographics).
When we find something interesting that warrants follow-up
and/or generalization to unseen locations,
we could then deploy our Google survey in select counties---using
it like a **survey microscope** (credit to Hal Varian for inventing the
terminology!). This could be done automatically
(it would be a pretty big, nonstationary [multi-armed bandit
problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit))
or manually (in collaboration with partners in public health and/or data
journalists). Stay tuned to the Delphi blog for updates.
