<p>Most pandemic research has focused on questions related to prediction such as:
how many COVID cases do we expect to see next week in Allegheny County? Causal
inference, on the other hand, is concerned with “what if” questions. For
example: what would happen if everyone wore masks? How many cases would there be
if there was a lockdown? How many deaths would occur if 40 percent of the
population is vaccinated? These questions involve hypothetical interventions on
a population.</p>
<p>Estimating causal effects is tricky. We all know that “correlation
isn’t causation.” For example, mask usage and cases could both
increase over time. But that doesn’t mean that masks cause more cases
to occur. Activation of “Buckle your seatbelt” signs on airplanes is
correlated with turbulence. But activating the sign does not cause
turbulence.</p>
<p>So how do we estimate causal effects? There is a collection of methods
for this task. The important thing is that we can’t just use standard
prediction methods. We need to use specialized methods that were designed
for causal inference. In this post we will discuss our work on
the causal effect of social mobility on deaths from COVID. The social mobility
variable we will use is the proportion of people staying home. We can think of
this of anti-mobility, and expect that higher values of this variable will lead
to fewer deaths from COVID.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a brief introduction to causal inference.</p>
<div id="causal-inference" class="section level2">
<h2>Causal Inference</h2>
<p>Causal inference
is a huge, complex topic.
We give a very brief
exposition of some key ideas here.
To learn more,
we recommend <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/">the book
by Hernan and Robins</a> and
the paper
“<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2289064">Statistics and Causal Inference</a>”
by Paul Holland
(<em>Journal of the American Statistical Association</em> 1986, pp. 945-960).
And one can find many tutorials
on the web.</p>
<p>Suppose we have
three variables
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, where
<span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is the outcome of interest
(such as deaths from COVID),
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a treatment or exposure
(such as mobility level),
and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> are confounding variables,
which are variables that affect both
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> (such as age).
The joint density is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
p(x,a,y) = p(x)p(a|x)p(y|x,a).
\]</span></p>
<p>We want to know: what would be the mean of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>
if we could set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to be equal to some value <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>?
For example,
what would the number of COVID cases be
if 92 percent of people wore masks?
We let <span class="math inline">\(Y^a\)</span>
denote this hypothetical outcome,
which is called a counterfactual or potential outcome.
And we denote the mean of <span class="math inline">\(Y^a\)</span> by
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}[Y^a]\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we have measured all the confounding variables
then the answer
(ignoring a few technical details)
is given by
Robins’ <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>-formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathbb{E}[Y^a] = \int \mu(x,a) p(x) dx = \mathbb{E}[\mu(X,a)]
\]</span></p>
<p>where
<span class="math inline">\(\mu(x,a) = \mathbb{E}[Y|X=x,A=a]\)</span>
is the mean of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.
This is not equal to
the mean of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(A=a\)</span>, which is
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}[Y|A=a] = \int \mu(x,a) p(x|a) dx\)</span>.
This is the difference between causation
and prediction (correlation).
You can think of
the <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>-formula as the mean of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>
if we replace <span class="math inline">\(p(a|x)\)</span>
in the joint density
with a point mass at <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>.
Using the <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>-formula is one example of <em>adjusting for
confounding</em>.</p>
<p>Now suppose we observe data
<span class="math inline">\((X_1,A_1,Y_1),\dots,(X_n,A_n,Y_n)\)</span>.
How do we estimate
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}[Y^a]\)</span>?
The simplest approach is to
get an estimate <span class="math inline">\(\hat\mu(x,a)\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mu(x,a)\)</span>
(this is just regression) and replace the integral
in the <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>-formula
with a sample average to get the estimate</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\hat{\mathbb{E}(Y^a)} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i \hat\mu(X_i,a).
\]</span></p>
<p>This is called the plug-in estimator. (Note that for prediction we would not use
this formula. We would just use <span class="math inline">\(\hat \mu(X, A)\)</span>.)
There are often better estimators,
but we won’t get into that here.
The important thing
is:
there is a formula for the causal effect
and we can estimate it.</p>
<p>The first plot below shows an example where we would predict
higher values of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is large. For pure prediction, this is
the correct conclusion. The second plot shows that once we
account for <span class="math inline">\(X = \text{age}\)</span> (corresponding to different colors) there is
a negative relationship between <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>: for a given person with a fixed
age, increasing <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> would <em>decrease</em> <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. In this case, age is a
confounder and the <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>-formula would correctly recover the negative
relationship. For causal inference, this is the correct conclusion.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-01-15-causal-effect-mobility_files/causal-simple-confounder.svg" /></p>
<p>Things get trickier
when there are time varying variables.
Consider weekly mobility and death data
<span class="math inline">\((A_1,Y_1),\dots, (A_T,Y_T)\)</span>
in one state.
For simplicity, we’ll assume that there are no <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> variables. But we’ll see that at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, the
variables <span class="math inline">\(Y_1, \dots, Y_{t-1}\)</span> are confounding variables for the causal effect of
mobility on <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span>.
Define
<span class="math inline">\(\overline{A}_t = (A_1,\dots, A_t)\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}_t = (Y_1,\dots, Y_t)\)</span>
for <span class="math inline">\(t\geq 1\)</span>.
The density
of <span class="math inline">\((\overline{y}_t,\overline{a}_t)\)</span>
can be written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
p(\overline{y}_t,\overline{a}_t) =
\prod_{s=1}^t p(y_s|\overline{y}_{s-1},\overline{a}_{s}) p(a_s|\overline{a}_{s-1},\overline{y}_{s-1}).
\]</span></p>
<p>Now consider
the causal question:</p>
<p>What would <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> be if we set
<span class="math inline">\(\overline{A}_t\)</span> equal to some value
<span class="math inline">\(\overline{a}_t =(a_1,\dots, a_t)\)</span>?</p>
<p>Let
<span class="math inline">\(Y^{\overline{a}_t}_t\)</span>
denote this counterfactual quantity.
For example, if <span class="math inline">\(A_t\)</span> is mobility,
measuring, say, the percentage of people who stay home,
and
<span class="math inline">\(\overline{a}_t = (12,12,12,6,6,6)\)</span>
then
<span class="math inline">\(Y^{\overline{a}_t}_t\)</span>
is the number of deaths
we would observe if we set mobility to 12 for three weeks
then set it to 6 for three weeks.</p>
<p>How do we
find the mean <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}[Y^{\overline{a}_t}_t]\)</span>?
As a general rule,
we adjust for pre-treatment variables but
not for post-treatment variables.
But in the time varying case,
this rule makes no sense.
Each <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> is both a pre-treatment variable
(it occurs before <span class="math inline">\(A_{t+1}\)</span>) and
a post-treatment variable
(it occurs after <span class="math inline">\(A_{t-1}\)</span>).
The correct way to
get the mean of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}[Y^{\overline{a}_t}]\)</span>
is to use the more general form
of the <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>-formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\psi(\overline{a}_t)\equiv
\mathbb{E}[Y^{\overline{a}_t}_t] =
\int\cdots\int
\mathbb{E} \left[Y_t | \overline{A}_t = \overline{a}_t, \overline{Y}_{t-1}=\overline{y}_{t-1}\right]
\prod_{s=1}^{t-1} p(y_s|\overline{y}_{s-1},\overline{a}_{s})
d y_s.
\]</span></p>
<p>You can ignore that equation
if you like;
suffice it to say that
there is indeed a formula
for the quantity we are interested in.</p>
<p>We note, by the way, that some authors denote
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}[Y^{\overline{a}_t}_t]\)</span> by
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}[Y_t| {\rm do}(\overline{a}_t)]\)</span>.
They mean the same thing.</p>
<p>Having a formula for
<span class="math inline">\(\psi(\overline{a}_t)\)</span>
is great, but how do we estimate it?
Again we could plug-in estimates
of all the quantities in
the <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>-formula.
But there are
better things we can do,
as we now explain.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-marginal-structural-model" class="section level2">
<h2>A Marginal Structural Model</h2>
<p>The approach we use is
to make use of
something called
a <em>marginal structural model</em> (MSM).</p>
<p>Usually when we construct
a statistical model,
we are trying to
come up with
a way to express the distribution
of the data, in this case,
<span class="math inline">\((A_1,Y_1),\dots, (A_T,Y_T)\)</span>.
In effect, we want a formula
that explains how we would generate
a dataset
like the one we have.
But to do so in a tractable way
usually involves making a bunch of
assumptions about the model.
Instead, with an MSM,
we specify a plausible
model for
the form of the function
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}[Y^{\overline{a}_t}]\)</span>
but we otherwise leave the model
for the data unspecified.
For example, we might assume
that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}[Y^{\overline{a}_t}]\approx \beta_0 + \beta \sum_s a_s\)</span>.
In a sense, we are spending our modeling assumptions wisely:
we want the effect of the treatment to be smooth
and fairly simple.
But we otherwise don’t want to impose assumptions.</p>
<p>The model we use is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathbb{E}[L_t^{\overline{a}_t}]= s(t) + \beta M_t
\]</span></p>
<p>where
<span class="math inline">\(L_t = \log (1+Y_t)\)</span> is log-deaths,
<span class="math inline">\(s(t)\)</span> is an arbitrary, smooth, increasing function
and</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
M_t = \sum_{s=1}^{t-\delta}(a_s-a_1)
\]</span></p>
<p>is cumulative mobility (compared to baseline mobility).
Based on published studies, we take <span class="math inline">\(\delta = 4\)</span> weeks.
(We switch from deaths to log-deaths mainly for
certain numerical reasons related to the software we are using.)
Here, <span class="math inline">\(s(t)\)</span> represents the
evolution of the pandemic if there were no
interventions and no reduction in
susceptible individuals.
The term <span class="math inline">\(\beta M_t\)</span> captures
the effect of mobility.
With no change in mobility,
deaths increase exponentially as <span class="math inline">\(e^{s(t)}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The intuition for using cumulative mobility
comes from ideas from epidemic modeling.
Roughly,
if <span class="math inline">\(I_t\)</span> denotes new infections in week <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>,
we might assume that
<span class="math inline">\(I_t \approx e^{\nu(t) + \beta A_t} I_{t-1}\)</span>
for some function <span class="math inline">\(\nu(t)\)</span>.
This implies that
<span class="math inline">\(I_{t-1} \approx e^{\nu(t-1) + \beta A_{t-1}} I_{t-2}\)</span>
and so on.
If we continue back to <span class="math inline">\(t=1\)</span> we find that
<span class="math inline">\(I_t \approx e^{s(t) + \beta \sum_s A_s} I_1\)</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(s(t)=\sum_{s=1}^t \nu(s)\)</span>.
If we further assume that
some fraction of people infected a time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>
will die in <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> weeks,
then we can derive the above model.
(More complex models are discussed in the paper.)</p>
<p>To re-cap:
we are leaving the
distribution <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> of the data
<span class="math inline">\((A_1,Y_1),\dots, (A_T,Y_T)\)</span>
unspecified,
except that we require:
if you apply
the <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>-formula
to <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> you must get
<span class="math inline">\(s(t) + \beta M_t\)</span>.
In other words,
the statistical model is the
set of all densities
<span class="math inline">\(p(\overline{\ell}_t,\overline{a}_t)\)</span> that satisfy the condition</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\int\cdots\int
\mathbb{E}[L_t | \overline{A}_t = \overline{a}_t, \overline{L}_{t-1}=\overline{\ell}_{t-1}]
\prod_{s=1}^{t-1} p(\ell_s|\overline{\ell}_{s-1},\overline{a}_{s})
d \ell_s =
s(t) + \beta M_t.
\]</span></p>
<p>This is an example of a semiparametric model:
a model that has some sort of constraint
but is otherwise nonparametric.</p>
<p>Estimating the MSM is a bit involved.
A key step is estimating the following function</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
W_t = \frac{p(a_t|\overline{a}_{t-1})}{p(a_t| \overline{y}_{t-1},\overline{a}_{t-1},\overline{x}_{t-1})}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\overline{x}_{t-1}\)</span>
represents potential confounding variables.
The model is fit with these weights
and the weights are crucial
because that is how we adjust for confounding in the MSM.
We won’t go into detail here.
Instead,
let’s look at the data
and the estimates.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-data-and-the-results" class="section level2">
<h2>The Data and the Results</h2>
<p>The data we use
are weekly deaths
and weekly averaged mobility
starting February 15 2019.
The mobility signal
we’ll consider here is the
proportion of people of who stay home,
which is kindly provided to Delphi by
SafeGraph.
(We {{< apireflink "api/covidcast-signals/safegraph.html" "publish this data" >}}
in our {{< apireflink "api/covidcast.html" "COVIDcast Epidata API" >}},
so it is available to anyone interested in studying mobility during the pandemic.)
We use data at the state level.
Note that this is actually a sort of anti-mobility measure:
the higher it is, the less mobility there is.

<p>After fitting the MSM,
we can estimate various quantities.
Let’s consider the effect
of changing the observed
stay-at-home series
<span class="math inline">\((A_1,\dots, A_T)\)</span>
to the hypothetical value
<span class="math inline">\(\overline{a}_T = (A_1+\gamma,\dots, A_T+\gamma)\)</span>.
In other words,
what would have happened
if we had increased stay-at-home by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>?
Below is the estimated
difference in deaths
(with 90 percent pointwise confidence bands)
for a few states:
Arizona, California, Florida and Georgia.
The plot shows the mean of</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Y_t^\gamma - Y_t
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> is the number of deaths
and
<span class="math inline">\(Y_t^\gamma\)</span>
is the (counterfactual) number of deaths
we would have observed of mobility had
been increases by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> at all times,
where we take <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = 10\)</span>
(a ten percent increase in stay-at-home).
The fact that the values
are negative
indicates that increasing
stay-at-home decreases deaths, as we would expect.
(We remind the reader
that these results are preliminary.)</p>

<div id="whats-next" class="section level2">
<h2>What’s Next?</h2>
<p>One important question in every
causal analysis is: what if there
is unobserved confounding?
In the current problem,
a confounder
is a variable that affects
both mobility and death from COVID.
We try to include as many plausible
observed confounding variables
as possible.
So far we use all
past values of death and mobility as
confounding variables.
But of course,
it is always possible
that there are unobserved confounders.
Currently,
we are conducting a sensitivity analysis
to assess how robust the estimates are
to unobserved confounders.</p>
<p>In this post we have only
addressed mobility.
As soon as the mobility analysis
is complete
we will turn our attention
to estimating
the causal effect of masks on COVID cases.</p>
