**Our mission:** To develop the theory and practice of epidemic detection, tracking and forecasting, and their use in decision making, both public and private.

**Our vision:** To make this technology as useful as weather forecasting is today.

- Founded in 2012 at Carnegie Mellon University, now spanning 3 universities
- Perennial winners of CDC’s [“predict the flu” challenge](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/flusight/index.html) since 2014
- Designated a 6-year [National Center of Excellence for Flu Forecasting](https://delphi.cmu.edu/about/center-of-excellence/) by [CDC’s Influenza Division](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/flu.html) (2019-2025)
- Designated a 5-year [National Center for Innovation](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/news/2023/delphi-cdc-center) by [CDC’s Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/index.html) (2023-2028)
- Our [Epidata repository](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/) of real-time, geographically-detailed epidemic signals contains more than 500 signals totalling over 4 billion records, with 3 million records being added daily.  It receives on average 100,000 queries/day, from more than 50,000 unique IP addresses in a 3 month period.
- Data partners and collaborators include CDC, UnitedHealth/Optum, Change Healthcare, Google, Meta, Amazon, QuidelOrtho, and others
- Funders include CDC, DTRA, Google, Meta, Optum, McCune Foundation, Uptake and others

**Our strategy:**
1. Procure [real-time, aggregated data streams](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/) informative of varied infectious diseases and syndromes, in collaboration with industry partners and public health agencies
1. Extract signals—many at daily and county-level resolution—from these streams and make them widely available via the [Delphi Epidata platform](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/) and [API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/); enhance their value with automated revision tracking, revision projection, anomaly detection, trend detection, access control, smoothing, and geographic, temporal and demographic disaggregation
1. Develop and deploy algorithms for epidemic detection, tracking (nowcasting), and forecasting
1. Develop and share tools for [signal access](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epidatr/), [processing](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epiprocess/), and [forecasting](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epipredict/)
1. Work closely with public health agencies to understand and support their needs
1. Make it all real-time, operational, maximally accessible, and open-source

**Our target users:**
- CDC, state and local public health agencies (STLTs)
  - Although our long term goal is global, our near-term focus is the U.S.)
- The epi-forecasting research community
- The healthcare industry
- Other public, private and government organizations
- Data journalists
- The general public
